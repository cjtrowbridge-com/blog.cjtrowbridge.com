I went to a [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/) meetup a couple days ago and spoke with several CEOs whose companies are focused on data science and machine learning. I asked about what languages they are looking for in new hires. These conversations cemented my desire to learn [Golang ](https://golang.org/)in conjunction with [TensorFlow ](https://www.tensorflow.org/)as my next major engineering paradigm.

#### "Hello, World!"

I started with a new [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) droplet at Digital Ocean ([Referal Link](https://m.do.co/c/ecb56e953504)) and followed [this tutorial](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-go-1-7-on-debian-8) from Digital Ocean to set up the server with the latest version of Golang and print out my first "Hello, World." #### Next Steps

Golang's site has a tutorial called [Writing Web Applications](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) which seems fairly comprehensive. I am going to work through this tutorial and then get started on the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.11/tutorials/) tutorials.
