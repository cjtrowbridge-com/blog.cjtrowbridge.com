**Content Analysis**1. Engage the community, they know best what they need 
    - Outreach leads to smarter, more efficient strategies
    - Closes knowledge gaps
2. Data helps, too 
    - Quantitative
    - Imperical
3. Opportunities come from overlap 
    - Collaboration is critical to identify innovative solutions 
        - NGOs
        - Public institutions

    - Reducing commute time adds value for people in cities
6. Politics persist 
    - work with political partners in order to achieve feasible solutions with greater reach
7. Civil society has a heightened role 
    - decisions or actions supported by political power are subject to pressure from civil society 
        - churches
        - community organizations
        - protest groups
8. Be inclusive 
    - Ensuring the most vulnerable access the services they need in a way that improves those systems for all
9. Be visionary 
    - seek to enact durable solutions
    - offer more opportunities to realize them
    - demand innovative and long-term solutions that are not only effective, but improve upon the original, pre-crisis condition
10. Have a long-term plan 
    - address immediate needs while striving to achieve a city's unique vision of the future
    - long-term visions are rarely achieved through an uncoordinated application of projects
