I was 14 when I had my first gig. I was suddenly [DJ-CJ](https://dj-cj.com) and making well over $100/hour... every once in a while. Today, things are different. There are any number of apps which will pay you to do work for them whenever you feel like it. This offers enormous flexibility and freedom alongside job-security and the ever elusive power to decide when to work.

> If you want to disappear for a week and go on an adventure, what's stopping you? Your work.

> If it's the middle of the night and you would rather be making money than partying or sleeping, what's stopping you? Your work.

> If you want to go back to school but cant afford to lose half your 9-5 work days, what's stopping you? Your work.

For these and many other reasons, I decided to try these gig apps and chronicle my experience. ![gig-apps](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gig-apps.fw_-1-1.png)Lyft and Uber are the obvious choices, but I also picked GrubHub, DoorDash, PostMates, UberEATS, Upwork, and a few others. Will keep you posted!
