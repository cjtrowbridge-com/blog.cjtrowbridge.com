When you are inside a digital world, the bounds are set, every edge is a polygon with a picture overlaid on it. It's digital. It's a list of facts that make it the same every time.

<div>  
</div><div>But what if inside the digital was an analog system. What if the only thing that's set is what you've already observed. What if everything is generated as you encounter it, with maybe a loose structure planned out, and it would just build the world as you encountered it. If the kernel was modulated by inputs, and the outputs were fuzzy-logic based on the inputs. Every time you played, it would be different, unpredictable. What if that idea extended to other media like characters, stories, web pages, music, or even video. What if inside the digital, there can be analog. It would be so much more like the real world. </div><div>  
</div><div>It would be almost real.</div>
