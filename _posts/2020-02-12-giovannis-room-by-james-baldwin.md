Giovanni's Room is not a true story, but it parallels the author's life. It's somewhere between a fictionalized autobiography and historical fiction. It's a very sad story which I really related to. [![Giovannis Room](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Giovannis-Room-1-1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/3bHaCwp)The story follows a young man in Paris who falls in love with another man, much to his own surprise. Everything goes horribly wrong and it doesn't end well for anyone. 8/10. Would recommend.
