            - In equilibrium, a stock's price should equal its "true" or intrinsic value: present value of future cash flows
            - Intrinsic value is a long-run concept
            - To the extent that investor perceptions are incorrect, a stock's price in the short run may deviate from its intrinsic value
            - Ideally, managers should avoid actions that reduce intrinsic value, even if those decisions increase the stock price in the short run

    - Stockholder-manager conflicts
        - Managers are naturally inclined to act in their own best interests (which are not always the same as the interests of stockholders)
        - The following factors affect managerial behavior:
            - Managerial compensation packages
            - Direct intervention by shareholders
            - The threat of firing
            - The threat of takeover
    
    
    - Stockholder-debtholder conflicts
        - Stockholders are more likely to prefer riskier projects because they receive more of the upside if the project succeeds.
        - Bondholders receive fixed payments and are more interested in limiting risk
        - Bondholders are particularly concerned about the use of additional debt
        - Bondholders attempt to protect themselves by including covenants in bond agreements that limit the use of additional debt and constrain managers' actions
