Tim Ferriss is in Kevin Rose's words, "very private," despite his very public personality and lifestyle business. We, the audience, see a very detailed and in-depth view of some parts of his life, but with things like love and relationships, he is more reserved. I have often felt curious about that side of him, and [this episode ](http://tim.blog/2017/05/21/esther-perel/)starts to pull back the veil just a bit.

This was a fascinating listen which left me feeling very unsure about how I feel about many of the topics they covered. Tim also recommends checking out her [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/speakers/esther_perel) which he describes as being, "on maintaining desire and rethinking infidelity." She also talks about several best-selling books she has written on this topic. This one in particular I intend to read... <iframe frameborder="0" height="150" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" scrolling="no" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ss&ref=as_ss_li_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=cj0e0-20&marketplace=amazon&region=US&placement=0060753641&asins=0060753641&linkId=21352e5d8414b53b8bb1a3949b059f2d&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true" style="width: 120px; height: 240px;" width="300"></iframe>I will relisten to this episode many times! \[embed\]http://traffic.libsyn.com/timferriss/The\_Tim\_Ferriss\_Show\_-\_Esther\_Perel.mp3\[/embed\]
