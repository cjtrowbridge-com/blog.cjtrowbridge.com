I read this book in just a few days. As soon as it came out, it was impossible to put down. ![Babylon's Ashes](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Babylons_Ashes-1-465x718.jpg)This book could almost be the second-half of the book before it. The story begins with a mess and ends with another, but ends in a place where you can see the silver lining in the clouds and the light at the end of the tunnel. Whereas Nemesis Games focused on Earth, this book focuses more on the expanse. ;P SPOILERS BELOW We still don't know who killed the gate builders or where they went! Or what the thing was in the nerve center, or what Duarte is doing. I also feel like the story is just beginning. The spacing guild and the fate of humanity have only just started to unfold. I can't wait for the next book. I can't wait for the rest of the show, and I hope they do many spin-offs to expand the rest of the story!
