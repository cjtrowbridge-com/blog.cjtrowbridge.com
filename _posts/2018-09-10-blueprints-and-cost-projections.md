## Blueprints

As you can see here, four side-facing murphy beds are at the rear of the trailer. These can fold up and down to allow lots of extra storage while in transit. Two Ikea 2x4 Kallax shelves are mounted to the walls just forward of the beds. These allow plenty of personal storage for campers. The very front wall of the trailer is covered with storage and appliances. These include a battery bank, a microwave, and a portable travel toilet as well as pantry space and a flatscreen tv. ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Stealth-Trailer-Blueprints-2-1-1.png)## Cost Projections

The biggest cost is the trailer itself at around $5,000 new. I am planning for a 7x14 trailer. This will also serve as storage and transportation for my DJ gear and other projects while not in use as a travel trailer. Next is the power bank. I want to get a Yeti GoalZero 3000 for this project, at $3,000. This will be able to store the power I am expecting to produce from the roof-mounted solar panels while also providing enough continuous power for all the lights and appliances I am planning for. Several small redundant power banks will run things like lights and air circulation, just like I did with my grid at [Burning Man 2018](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2018/08/04/gear-list-burning-man-2018/). The solar array is less pricey than the batteries. Nine panels fit neatly on the roof. I plan to get these from the highly reputable company Renogy at a cost of just $1070.91. Next is the beds. I want to get four [memory foam twin-sized mattresses](https://amzn.to/2x0WH2R) at a total cost of $1,134. I have back problems, so I prefer to only sleep on memory foam mattresses. I also want to include a microwave. Using these to boil water and heat up hungry man meals is a simple solution which is well within the power production I have planned for the solar array. This will cost just $50. In the future, I may add refrigeration.
