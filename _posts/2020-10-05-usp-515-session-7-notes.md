#### **<span class="">ASSIGNED READING FOR SESSION SEVEN</span>**

</div><div id="yui_3_17_2_1_1601920422918_122">1. <span class="" id="yui_3_17_2_1_1601920422918_119">Undocumented U.S. Immigrants and Covid-19 by Kathleen R. Page et al. </span>
    - “USCIS encourages all those, including aliens, with symptoms that resemble Coronavirus Disease 2019 (Covid-19) (fever, cough, shortness of breath) to seek necessary medical treatment or preventive services. Such treatment or preventive services will not negatively affect any alien as part of a future Public Charge analysis.”
    - Under the Trump administration, immigrants have faced relentless attacks — tightening of the public charge rule, threats to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), asylum restrictions, and separation of families at the border — so immigrants are justifiably scared.
    - Covid-19 has exposed weaknesses in the U.S. health system. The country faces shortages of personal protective equipment, tests, and ventilators.
    - The Affordable Care Act excludes undocumented immigrants from eligibility for coverage, and an estimated 7.1 million undocumented immigrants lack health insurance.
    - As the country has adopted a suppression strategy, people have been asked to stay home as much as possible. The profound economic impact of these measures will be especially harsh for undocumented immigrants, many of whom work in service industries such as restaurants and hotels, or in the informal economy.
    - The $1 trillion economic relief package, which includes paid-leave benefits and direct cash for Americans, will not reach most undocumented immigrants or their families.
    - The disenrollment of immigrant families from SNAP over the past year takes on new meaning in light of the economic crisis resulting from Covid-19. With children home from school, the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service has relaxed guidelines to enable summer food service and national school lunch programs to serve meals in noncongregate settings, but children of immigrants who disenrolled in SNAP will not receive these services.
    - Immigrants are part of our national fabric. Undocumented immigrants make vital contributions to the economy. Many have low-wage essential jobs as home health aides and will be helping our vulnerable elders.
2. <span class="">The Black New Deal</span>
    - Across the country, Black People are being infected and dying at disportionate rates from COVID-19. In order to respond effectively to the needs of the Black community our elected officials, health experts, advocates and organizers must take a look at the ways in which the descendants of slaves, Black, African and African-Americans are most impacted by this virus through a racial and class lens.
    - This is a state of emergency for Black people that demands immediate action equal to those enacted in the presence of such a declaration.
    - Demands 
        - Publish desegregated data by race and zip code to properly track spread and to inform allocation of resources.
        - No person, company or entity should be allowed to profit off of a pandemic. Nor should the city of Oakland direct COVID disaster funding towards ongoing development plans without being informed by relevant data to support those decisions as being a science based response to the pandemic.
        - No government can place a demand on a people without incurring responsibility for the costs those demands will exact free masks for all, testing, retesting, contact tracing and healthcare, internet access, etc.
        - Reparations for Black people, who as a demographic are is proportionately affected in this moment as a result of historic structural, institutional, and systemic racism

        - Data is collected and that the race of all people impacted and the outcomes of their interaction with COVID 19 such as hospitalization, ventilation, or death, are recorded and desegregated by zip code.
        - Ventilation and other care for COVID 19 not be denied due to anti-Blackness.
        - Systemic racism be addressed, through both short and long term solutions, as a root cause of the disproportionate impact of COVID 19 on Black people.
        - Alameda County to scale up their overall testing capacity, as more testing sites are needed countywide, including in many hospitals such as Highland Hospital.
        - All people are entitled to free masks, testing, contact tracing, and care - especially people who are currently incarcerated, living in congregate living situations, and newly released and entering into a living situation with family and/or other people.
        - Consistent best practices put in place, monitored, and enforced in all congregant living spaces that house vulnerable minority populations in danger of being infected by staff or one another, mass death due to lack of intentional care should be considered as a threat to life.
        - An end to all permits regarding potential pollutants in opportunity zones, closures for non-essential businesses that impact the environment, and concrete action on factors contributing to a toxic environment in Oakland.
        - Free healthcare and access to testing, including antibody testing, for all people.
        - Testing and a policy concerning containment at transitional homes.

        - Universal passage of all students during this time due to lack of technology equity and redistribution of resources to ensure that all students have access to what they need.
        - Measures to increase access to the internet including buses with wifi in neighborhoods to provide internet access and making internet a public utility to ensure access for all.
        - Shelter, housing protections, and healthcare for all students and their families.
        - No criminalization of youth in Oakland related to COVID 19 precautions such as wearing a mask, etc.
        - Investment in community schools once students return, with wraparound services such as health clinics, nurses, mental health services, food for students and families.
        - Divest in school police departments altogether and invest instead in health services, arts and culture programming, and student supports.
        - Recognize the difficulty of distance learning for many students and create accessible resources. All students should have equal access.

        - Small businesses with fewer than 500 employees to receive no interest loans, reimbursements, and debt forgiveness.
        - Right to return requirement to combat systemic racism for all employees.
        - Community oversight body to ensure that "return to normal" does not usher in a new era of even more violent capitalism and greater dispossession for Black people and businesses.
        - Transparency around the cruise ship that docked in Oakland and the impacts on the workers, as well as free healthcare and testing for all workers who were exposed and their families. And any other major events that jeopardize the health and safety of workers, and communities the right to know.
        - The ability to declare and receive compensation for a standby for health and safety.
        - Right to return for workers who are laid off and right to stay for workers who do not want to leave their jobs. And right to return to those who elect to protect their health in a pandemic.
        - Protection for Black union leaders.
        - Congress should create a supplementary direct assistance program for the self-employed and microbusinesses to help cover the cost of lost business, paid sick leave, individual health care costs, and fixed expenses.
        - Self-employed Americans depend on critical e-commerce infrastructure, including financial services, shipping, and Internet connectivity. The federal government should ensure that these essential services remain fully operational, even as the public and private sectors take greater measures to contain the spread of the virus.
        - PPES mandatory for all Frontline and essential workers. State/County/City should make them available to employers at cost. Currently they have to get them at retail this is an additional cost they can afford.
        - Employers should receive subsidies as an incentive to protect their workers.
        - Unemployment Insurance rates should not increase because of COVID layoffs; rates should stay flat.
        - Workers compensation insurance should be covered for employers so that they do not take a hit when workers are out sick with COVID 19.
        - Congress should expand Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) by increasing the income threshold (which is dependent on a number of factors), including younger and childless workers, and eliminating the marriage penalty. Lawmakers should also allow it to be calculated and administered on a quarterly basis instead of annually, which would better support individuals struggling to manage short-term income volatility.
        - The City of Oakland and the County of Alameda should help facilitate a local Small Business Relief fund. The fund will be Hosted by The California Endowment, the Small Business Relief Fund to provide immediate support to struggling self-employed and small business owners. TCE will partner with Opportunity Fund, California's largest nonprofit microlender, to ensure critical capital remains available to these entities throughout this crisis.
        - Six-month income replacement program conditioned upon full and continued employment of all restaurant staff, payment of rents to landlords, and ongoing payables to suppliers.
        - Provide rent abatement for the duration of the administrative closure followed by percentage rent through 2020 for tenants. This must be coupled with mortgage forgiveness for landlords.
        - Suspend state sales and payroll tax through end of year. Permit deferral of utility payments until reopening. Mandate that fees charged by third-party delivery platforms to our local restaurants be capped at a maximum 10% of the order.
        - Require business loss insurance to cover COVID-19 closures for hospitality businesses. The Governor must declare that the pandemic has caused physical loss and damage.
        - Suspend the payment of all insurance premiums (and, protect against a spike in premium related to COVID-19), utility payments, fines and provide cure periods to businesses for violations that do not pose an immediate hazard to the public and workers. All taxes, fees, premiums and fines must be suspended indefinitely until a thorough and thoughtful strategy can be implemented to address these payments.
        - Add flexibility to the definition of small business to allow small to mid-size restaurants to apply for aid.
        - Establish an on-call pool of African American restaurants to provide food and beverages throughout all city departments for all events, functions, meetings, etc. This list is not exhaustive.

Re-entry resources for people who are released, including financial support, identification, food, housing, MediCal and funds for family members who house and care for newly released people. The removal of barriers resulting from a criminal record in accessing key essential human necessities. End the militarization of police. No national guard or military enforcement. No further criminalization, fines or arrest of Black people based on the COVID 19 mandates, including orders on masks, travel, etc. especially for unhoused people who are disproportionately targeted and impacted.

3. <span class="">Environmental Justice's Role in the COVID-19 Crisis</span>
    - Ibram X. Kendi, Director of the Antiracist Research and Policy Center at American University, has led the call for states, counties, and labs to report racial demographics of the people being tested for, infected with, hospitalized with, or killed by the virus. 
        - “Sometimes racial data tells us something we don’t know. Other times we need racial data to confirm something we already seem to know,” says Kendi.
    - For decades, researchers, and activists have documented the racial disparities that cause the underlying conditions leaving communities of color vulnerable. These systems show patterns of discriminatory practices that are all too apparent to be coincidental.
    - Lubna Ahmed, director of environmental health at WE ACT for Environmental Justice, stated, “In public health, it’s often said that your ZIP code is more indicative of your health outcomes than your genetic code.”
    - The placement of coal plants, waste incinerators, refineries, landfills, bus depots, and other sites in communities of color has long emitted toxic pollutants into the water and particulate matter into the air. Air pollutants enter through the lung and go into the bloodstream and are linked to cardiovascular and pulmonary disease, chronic health issues that increase chances of contracting severe cases of COVID-19. The Harvard study also points out bad indoor air quality and poor ventilation are prevalent in low-income housing.
    - We must apply a historic lens and complete demographic data on virus cases when allocating resources and supporting communities. We need to ensure there are not just emergency supplies provided, but also an inspection of how underlying conditions are created and can be fixed. We need leaders that understand these inequities and fight to change systems. To create justice, marginalized communities must have decision-making roles in regards to their health, homes, and futures.
4. <span class="">Essential Workers Denied Compensation For Job-Related COVID-19 </span>
    - several front-line workers addressed lawmakers Wednesday, calling for the state to enact a more robust set of protections for essential workers who believe they contracted the novel coronavirus while doing their job.
    - Rogers and workers’ advocates, including the AFL-CIO and the National Employment Law Project, want legislators to make the state’s coronavirus workers’ compensation laws presumptive. 
        - That would mean if an essential worker got sick with COVID, it would be on the employer to prove that it wasn’t the job that got the worker sick -- not on the employee to prove that the job did get them sick.
    - Joe Brennan from the Connecticut Business and Industry Association said a broad-brush presumptive provision could punish cash-strapped employers who made the decision to stay open for the public good. 
        - "We’re not going to be able to accept the fact that every single employee that’s determined to be ‘essential’ … that anybody that gets COVID is going to be a workers’ comp case. I think that’s going to be extremely problematic for the system,” Brennan said.
5. <span class="">Exposure By Patrick Skahill</span>
    - ?
6. <span class="">Connecting the Dots Between Environmental Injustice and the Coronavirus By Kathrine Bagley</span>
    - Low-income and minority communities have been hit hardest by covid
    - structural inequalities are a major driver of why we see these different social and environmental conditions in communities of color.
    - You see these different patterns of land uses, whether it be transportation networks, large highways where you have a lot of traffic, or industrial activity.
    - There’s a recent Harvard study that shows that with long-term exposure to PM2.5 \[fine particulate air pollution\], there’s an association with higher mortality rates for individuals who had a Covid-19 infection. We have a pattern in this country, where communities of color and low-income communities host more of these \[heavily polluting\] land uses. I think that has played a major role in why we see the disparate impacts of Covid-19 as it relates to morbidity and mortality rates.
    - higher levels of air pollution were linked to an 8-percent rise in the Covid-19 death rate
    - “We have a lot of communities that are basically sacrifice zones because they are dumping grounds for polluting facilities.”
    - PM2.5 itself causes asthma, heart disease, stroke. It elevates blood pressure. It increases infant mortality rates. It can cause birth defects. It can cause low-birth-weight births. It also can cause diabetes, cancer, premature mortality. That’s PM2.5 by itself.
    - these \[Trump administration\] rollbacks that’s really problematic for communities impacted by environmental injustice.
7. <span class="">Coronavirus is not just a health crisis — it’s an environmental justice crisis By Yvette Cabrera</span>
    - “Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point" -MLK
    - The COVID-19 pandemic is not just a health crisis, it’s an environmental justice crisis.
    - The environmental movement should reckon with the disproportionate effects of environmental contamination
    - as skyrocketing unemployment is predicted to increase poverty rates and widen racial disparities, these same communities find themselves in the crosshairs of COVID-19. In Chicago, African Americans represent 60 percent of the city’s COVID-19-related deaths, despite only comprising 30 percent of the city’s population. African Americans in states such as Michigan, Illinois, and Louisiana have also been disproportionately killed by COVID-19 — and early data suggest the disparity could be widest in the South.
    - Decades ago, sociologist and civil rights activist W.E.B. DuBois zeroed in on how social and environmental conditions led to health disparities between black and whites, and he offered solutions that addressed the physical environment.
    - COVID-19 is one more chapter in this saga, and we’re seeing that the severity of outcomes is related to a person’s environment. Public health researchers and advocates are concerned that those who live in polluted neighborhoods will fare the worst. It’s why residents are pleading for stronger air pollution regulations in San Bernardino, California, and why residents of Louisiana’s St. James Parish are battling yet another plastics plant.
8. <span class="">A State-by-state look at Coronavirus in Prisons - The Marshall Project</span>
    - Coronavirus infection rates are extremely high in prisons compared to the outside population 
        - 545 basis points for California prisons versus 130 for San Francisco and 208 for California
        - 1598 for NJ prisons versus 229 for NJ
    - Death rates are also extremely high 
        - 27 basis points death rate for NJ prisoners versus 18 for general NJ public
