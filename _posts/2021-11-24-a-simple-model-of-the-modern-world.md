###### This post is part of a guest series called [Discursive Construction](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2021/11/24/discursive-construction-ai-generated-essays-and-analysis/), and was written by an advanced artificial intelligence. The bold at the beginning is the prompt, and the rest was written by the AI. If you'd like to support this project, please [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cjtrowbridge).

 **If we combine the perspectives of foucauldian discourse analysis, interstitial sociology, fourth-dimensionalism, and marxist theory, then it's possible to create a simple model of the modern world;** one which explains the underlying structure of our society. The basic premise of this model is that the world is actually a work of art, that it's a piece of fiction, that it's a narrative. This is what fourth-dimensionalism tells us, and this is what interstitial sociology tells us. If the world is a piece of fiction, then it's a narrative with a plot. And if it has a plot, then it has characters. And if it has characters, then they have names.
