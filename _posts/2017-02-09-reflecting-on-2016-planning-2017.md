Note: this post is very flow-of-thought and was composed over several days. The goals derived from it are more structured and can be found at [accomplish.cjtrowbridge.com](https://accomplish.cjtrowbridge.com/). Looking back, most of my goals for 2016 were learning goals, and went unaccomplished. All but one of my non-learning goals was accomplished. I successfully doubled my income, I learned to sail, I bought a new car, I revisited hobbies like Amateur Radio. Sadly, I did not find time for starting a new business selling food. I did want to put more emphasis on my learning goals, but I think I struggled this year with defining myself on the spectrum between polymathism and specializing in mastering a smaller skill set as advocated by Peter Thiel in [Zero to One](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2016/12/18/zero-to-one-by-peter-thiel/). After reading lots of books on the topic and attending Burning Man, I think I can confidently say that I lean polymath on that spectrum. I would rather dabble in many things than specialize in a few. I might have guessed as much based on the example of my forebearers. With this aspect of myself finally defined, I feel freer to expand my focus on more skills as I had planned to in 2016. My main priority for 2017 will be finding independence and security in the many areas I am currently dependent and over-committed, such as:

- I want to eliminate all debt and start saving and investing.
- I want to start at least one formal business and several informal side-projects which turn profits.
- I want to remove or eliminate all recurring costs wherever possible.

I also want to renew my focus on learning. - I want to be proficient in more programming languages and frameworks. 
    - C++
    - C#
    - Golang
    - NodeJS
    - JS
    - Angular
    - React
- I want to learn new skills 
    - Learn to fly
    - Learn the constellations

I make lots of apps that people use, but none of them are mine. I want to develop web applications that people use which belong exclusively to me. These should not be in languages which I am already familiar with; rather new languages I learn. Likely Golang or C++ would be ideal candidates for this. Perhaps with new implementations of Astria? I want to again double my income. This will certainly require income diversification as my current job can not double in value again this year. Revisiting side gigs will be a primary focus. A lot of lucrative projects fell by the wayside as my focus narrowed during 2016, and deserve revival: - [DJ-CJ](https://dj-cj.com) This is easy and makes a lot of money. I need to get back into it. I want to expand my previous work to include regular content creation via perhaps a weekly educational podcast on the current top 40(?)
- Food Carts: This is such a good idea which I have a track record of success with. There is just no reason I am not still doing this.
- Growing Food: I have been talking about this for years, and I wish I had made more progress. This is so important and it's only going to become more important. I want to get to at least a prototype this year.
- RaaS: Referrals are the best form of marketing, and a real problem which has not been cracked yet. There should be a simple way to sign up for a platform which automatically incentivizes your customers to evangelize and then automatically rewards them.
- Professional Fundraising: Raise money for worthy causes by throwing fundraiser events.
- FSaaS: My work in field services management has led me to believe that the current field services industry is terrible and needs transformative change. I see huge potential in combining something like Magic with something like Postmates. There is just no reason that there is not a general-purpose field services as a service company. I have been developing this idea since June 2016, and it would be a natural extension of my previous work and highly lucrative.
