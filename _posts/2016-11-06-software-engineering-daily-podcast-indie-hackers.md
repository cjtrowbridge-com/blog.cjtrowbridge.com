In essence, this is a site about smart creative tech people with good side projects that are making them money and helping facilitate the digital nomad lifestyle. It also offered praise to inspirational nomad [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/) and his project [nomadlist.com](https://nomadlist.com/). \[embed\]http://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Software-Engineering-Daily-Podcast-indiehackers\_edited.mp3\[/embed\]
