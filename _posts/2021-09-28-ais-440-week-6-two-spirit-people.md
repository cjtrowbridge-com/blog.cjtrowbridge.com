This response needs to be a minimum of two paragraphs in length and requires two sources. Sources can include anything from the QIS book or any of the videos or articles assigned in class. You may also include sources not assigned in class. Be sure to include your citation at the end.</div> Example: In Queer Indigenous Studies, Finley writes "Native women are necessary for the imaginary origin story of the U.S." (p. 36). The continued sexualization of Native women has led to a crisis of epidemic proportions wherein Native women in the US and Canada are going missing and murdered at extremely high rates. I believe the necessary steps are for the US and Canadian governments to work directly with Tribal nations, Tribal NGOs, and women centric NGOs to implement policies that help Native women and tribal/urban Native communities eradicate this horrific phenomenon.
