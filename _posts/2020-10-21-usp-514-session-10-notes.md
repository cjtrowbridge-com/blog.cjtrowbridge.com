**<span class="">October 19th and 21st</span><span class="">Session Ten: Sustainable Urban Waste Management</span>**<span class="">This session will focus on the approaches, policies, and practices that can promote sustainable waste management and resource recovery. We will be guided by the following questions.</span>**Waste is unwanted material intentionally thrown away for disposal.**1. <span class="">What are the basic characteristics of waste as it relates to urban waste management issues?</span>
    - Solid vs liquid
    - Organic vs inorganic
    - Human activities 
        - Agriculture, husbandry
        - Energy sources
        - Water collection and use
        - Building shelters and buildings
        - Making tools and other objects for cultural, industrial and spiritual reasons
        - Conflict and warfare
    - Production of products with toxic materials
2. <span class="">What waste management systems and technologies have been developed by planners in the “industrialized world”?</span>
    - Landfills
    - Recycling
    - Composting
3. <span class="">What are the environmental and social impacts of these waste management systems and technologies?</span>
    - The waste stream has become much more toxic
    - Accumulation of toxics in the waste stream 
        - Toxins like dioxin are now in the breast milk of every woman on earth.
    - Accumulation of inorganic material in the waste stream
4. <span class="">What alternative systems and technologies can be put into place? </span>
    - We have to move from a waste management approach to a resource recovery approach. ("Because approach is the highest level") 
        - Composting: 40% of the waste in landfills is food waste
        - Ashes
        - Cans and bottles
        - Electronics recycling
        - Thrift stores
    - Cradle to grave vs cradle to cradle
    - RRRR: Reduce, reuse, recycle, rot
    - Up-cycling, down-cycling
5. <span class="">How viable are these alternatives?</span>
    - These alternatives are extremely viable
    - They are used throughout Europe
6. <span class="">How can waste management professionals promote sustainable waste management and use?</span>

    - Resource economy is a linear process with many open loops, therefore not sustainable.
    - 1/3 of our initial natural resources are now gone.
    - Less than 4% of natural forests remain in the US.
    - 5% of the word's population lives in the US 
        - US uses 30% of the world's resources
        - US creates 30% of the world's waste
    - 80% of the planets forests are now gone
    - 75% of fisheries are fished over their capacity

    - <div class="style-scope ytd-expander" id="content"><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Externalized cost: </span> <span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">the real cost are not how much we buy it.</span> <span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">people in extraction use their natural resources to pay</span></div>

        - Planned obsolescence: products designed to fail so you have to buy a new one
        - <div class="style-scope ytd-expander" id="content"><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Perceived obsolescence: New products designed to look new; creating social pressure for others to buy new things</span></div>

    - National happiness is going down while consumption is going up
    - We have less leisure time than at any point since feudal society
    - <div class="style-scope ytd-expander" id="content"><span class="style-scope yt-formatted-string" dir="auto">Disposal: They burn the garbage you make and pollute to the air</span></div>
    - <div class="style-scope ytd-expander" id="content">Recycling is good</div>
        - Reduces waste and reduces inputs
        - Much of the garbage can't be recycled because it's toxic or it's designed to be impossible to recycle (ie tetra-packs)
    - One can of trash in front of your house means 71 cans of trash upstream in order to make the stuff in your one can of trash
