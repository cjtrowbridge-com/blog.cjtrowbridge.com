Last year, I switched to T-Mobile; a choice which has come with lots of perks. One of them was that they gave me a free router. This router supports the 802.11ac standard which means it forms very good connections to devices because of new nanotech in the antennas that allow "beam-forming" to focus the energy of the antenna towards only the devices it is connected to. Giving me a nice router benefits T-Mobile because my phone supports wifi-calling which decreases the load on their network. I actually ended up porting my number to Google Voice which means I have unlimited free wifi texting as well as calling now, but that's covered in [another post](http://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2015/10/12/moving-my-phone-number-to-the-cloud/).
