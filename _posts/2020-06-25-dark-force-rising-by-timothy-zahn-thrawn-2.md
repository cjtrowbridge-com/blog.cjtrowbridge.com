[![Dark Force Rising by Timothy Zahn](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dark-Force-Rising-by-Timothy-Zahn-1-1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/3i3sRRi)[Dark Force Rising](https://amzn.to/3i3sRRi) was a cool book. I liked the focus on Kardde, who became probably my favorite character in the series so far. He is described as basically what Han might have been in he had not found the rebellion. Like the opposite of Jabba; an underworld crime boss who is honorable and inspires loyalty. This book inspired me to read a lot more about Kardde and queue up the rest of the books about him. We also got to see a lot of Thrawn's machinations and secrets explored. There is a lot of build-up like he has some grand plan for the last book. Very excited to see what happens. It also made me interested to explore more about the high republic era and the history of the dark force. I would definitely recommend this book to any Star Wars fan.
