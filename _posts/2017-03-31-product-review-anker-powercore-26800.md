I recently bought an [Anker PowerCore+ 26800](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K6TA748/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01K6TA748&linkCode=as2&tag=cjtrowbridge-20&linkId=e072710f1cdbc7c05fe2d5381e8ce92a) to add to my [EDC](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/category/personal/blog/every-day-carry/).[![Anker PowerCore+ 26800, Premium Portable Charger, High Capacity 26800mAh External Battery with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 (in- and output), Includes PowerPort+ 1 Wall Charger](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41MAfblNuJL.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K6TA748/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B01K6TA748&linkCode=as2&tag=cjtrowbridge-20&linkId=e072710f1cdbc7c05fe2d5381e8ce92a)It has several big Pros and one big Con.

#### Pros

- 26,800mah of capacity means it will charge my phone almost seven times on a single charge. This will be perfect for Burning Man!
- Quick Charge 3.0 means it will charge very quickly and it will charge devices very quickly. This is also exciting because this standard will be supported by the new chromebooks which are coming out later this year.

#### CON

- It uses Micro-USB input which is STUPID AND RIDICULOUS. I guess I am not rid of that standard after all.

#### Conclusion

- I didn't return it. But I am not happy about the stupid, obsolete input type.
