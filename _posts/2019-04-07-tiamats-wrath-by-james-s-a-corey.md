The most recent book in The Expanse series is easily one of the best so far. The last couple books have felt a little flat, and felt like they were setting up the next one. This one is what they were setting up. It's full of action and has an ending. Many of the major arcs see significant development. Many story lines are tied up by the end. It's a very satisfying read. You can get the audio book for free [here](https://amzn.to/2D1ZdZM) or by asking me for a copy. [![Tiamat's Wrath by James S. A.
