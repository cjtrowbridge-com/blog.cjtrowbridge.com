title: 'Fleeing destruction and the wrath of the rain gods, the colonists moved into what they thought would be a new safe home for their people; a bright tomorrow and the promise of a better future. But little did they know, the milk and honey they drank was poisoned. Their new land of promise and plenty was ruled by even more malevolent and insidious gods with powerful magic which no amount of hope and prayer could serve to overcome. As the last of them lay gasping for breath, surrounded by dead kin, she wondered if anyone would remember her and her people.'
