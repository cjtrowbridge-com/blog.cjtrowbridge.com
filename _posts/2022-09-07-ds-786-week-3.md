        - Let's consider more patterns
        - Smoothing filters work best for stable timeseries data when there aren't trends or seasonality
        - Seasonality (like sine waves) is its own thing with different analytical techniques
        - Trends up and down are not good for smoothing filters; regressions are
        - Nonlinear trend analysis
            - Not what we're doing in this class
        - Linear trend analysis
            - y=mx+b
            - Finding the intercept and slope lets us make predictions about the future
            - All forecasts work better in the short-term than the long-term
    
    
    - [Associative Forecasting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9Up0ntQwYo)
        - Maybe other variables are better for regressions than time.
        - An associative forecast compares variables rather than using time as a variable.
        - Linear regression
            - Linear trend analysis 
                - y = intercept + slope \* time
            - Associative forecast
                - y = intercept + slope \* value of second variable at each time
    
    
    - [What makes regressions accurate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDvsxYogm0I)
        - r^2 is the percentage of variation in y that is explained by x
        - correlation (r)
            - Correlations can be positive and negative
                - Positive: trend together
                - Negative: trend in opposite directions
            - Correlations can be spurious
            - Correlation is signed, where r^2 gives an absolute value.
