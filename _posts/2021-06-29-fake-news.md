I think in many cases there are fundamental epistemic differences between people of different ideologies, and we need to learn to distinguish those kinds of claims from bad faith claims. Like if a trump supporter says he's coming back in August, they really believe that to be true. And that's different from Putin's fake newspapers putting out stories that no one believes in. The far right often acts in what they see as good faith based on their assumptions about reality. I think it is a failure of discourse to dismiss their fundamental beliefs about reality as equivalent to news sources which have been deliberately constructed to push a narrative which its own authors regard to be false.
