[The Broken Earth book series](https://amzn.to/2WlgGcH) was recommended by a close friend. It is an amazing read. Afrofuturism in general is always amazingly insightful, and I find that's especially true when it's distant-future Afrofuturism. [![The Broken Earth](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/The-Broken-Earth-1-1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2WlgGcH)These books paint a picture of a post-apocalyptic world, but it's a world that has passed so many apocalypses that the landscape is dotted with relics of ancient civilizations which are in today's distant future. The worldbuilding is really great. Also the world is full of functionalist institutions, and the story centers on those who reject their assigned functions. It's a deeply queer post-structuralist discourse and a critique of caste structures and adherence to our socialized roles in society. It's also an admonition to actively reject and usurp those roles and institutions. I highly recommend this book to any fan of Queer Theory, Quare Theory (Racially-situated post-structuralism), post-structuralism, or Afrofuturism.
