<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-3">#### This Week

- Advance on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/algebra-basics)
    - I am frustrated by a lack of time. This will change soon, but I have set up a forked strategy for the coming year. Either my work contract will be settled, and I will continue working at Tech 2U, go to Sierra and worry about this later, or I will use my new days off to go to ARC where my assessments render this step un-necessary. Either way, I am removing this goal.
- Stay up on [Medium](https://medium.com/)
    - I have done a great job of staying up on Medium every day, and contributing regularly. I will expand this goal to include contributing regularly.
- Advance on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains)
    - I have not had time for this, but with my coming transition, I will hope to make more time to advance here.
- Read [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
    - I still read this almost every day. I will pin it to chrome to keep it fresh in my mind.
- Read [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses)
    - I have stayed up on this as well as SE Daily. I am feeling inspired and continuing to absorb.
- Earn $100 with Lyft 
    - I have far surpassed this goal. I think one or two nights a week is realistically more than enough to accomplish this.
- Earn $100 with Uber 
    - I have far surpassed this goal. I think one or two nights a week is realistically more than enough to accomplish this.
- Earn $200 with Upwork 
    - I have not yet completed this. I will make a calendar entry to try to get this done this week.
- Eat Less, Eat Better, Drink More Water 
    - I think I have more or less done well here. I certainly have room to grow, and I ordered more soylent to that end as well as doing better grocery shopping.
- Play [Chess](https://www.chesscademy.com/)
    - I have not played chess in weeks. I am setting a firm goal to play a game this wednesday.
- Learn a new [skill](https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/21-best-places-to-learn-new-skills-every-day-722fdaf7530c#.peg4gey2d)
    - This has fallen by the wayside. I will hopefully have time this week.
- Try a new [hobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies)
    - This has fallen by the wayside. I will hopefully have time this week.
- Yoga 
    - I have done some yoga, and I am scheduled to do more this wednesday night.
- Kayaking 
    - It has been cold. I have been looking at a new hard-bottom kayak that would make this easier.
- Watch a [documentary](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/)
    - I really want to watch Adam Curtis' new one. I will create a calendar entry for this week.
- Blog post about each major area of focus. Enumerate learning and accomplishments, direction, and upcoming goals.
