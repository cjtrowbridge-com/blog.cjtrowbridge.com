After several years away, I'm finally returning to the playa. This post marks the beginning of planning for the 2025 burn.  

A big part of the reason I haven't gone for the last couple years has been an intense sense of disappointment and frustration with the leadership of my camp and the org. It feels like these perspectives have broadly become consensus, which makes me feel less dissonant about coming back and feeling more surrounded by people who share a critical lens on the issues that no one seemed to care about a few years ago.  

Also, I will be continuing my journey out from the core. I started in 2016 with Laughing Monkey on Esplanade. That was insane. Then I joined Comfort & Joy which moved a block outwards after my first year with them.  

This year, I plan to camp with friends, closer on the city's edge. I am doing a man installation about radio technology, but this will not be a "working man."
