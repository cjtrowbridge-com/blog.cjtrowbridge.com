Super interesting research into stress related to dominance versus submission in social rank and lots of research about specific health consequences. One of the strangest things I would not have expected is a connection between social submissiveness and the amount of body fat specific to the abdomen. Social submissiveness is also directly connected to very high stress hormone levels across the board compared to socially dominant individuals. This also leads to higher blood pressure for submissives, lower immune system, greater risk of cardiovascular disease, shrinking brain cells, lower memory and learning performance, and more arterial plaques. This is all true across lots of different mammal species including humans, macaques, and baboons. Super weird and interesting. Watch this documentary! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYG0ZuTv5rs
