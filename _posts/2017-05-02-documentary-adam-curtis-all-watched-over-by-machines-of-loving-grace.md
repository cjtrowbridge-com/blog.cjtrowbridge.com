Years ago, I came across this documentary series and was struck by its intense and unusual style. Adam Curtis has become one of my favorite documentarians. Luckily for me, he is prolific. His new documentary [Hypernormalisation ](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2017/05/02/documentary-adamâ€¦pernormalisation/)is one of his best. All of his work is about the interplay between power and economics and politics. All Watched Over By Machines of Loving Grace focuses largely on the idealism of Ayn Rand and her followers and how they built the "New Economy" on top of new information technologies. Curtis is very critical of Rand and her ideas and the way that most of it did not work out how they wanted. As a tech entrepreneur who aspires to climb echelons and maximize my impact, this topic was close to my heart. I found myself feeling very conflicted about both sides of this argument. After watching this series, I was compelled to read Atlas Shrugged twice. Both have given me many questions and few answers, but I feel like they are the right questions. <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2XPGRmRCk4U" width="560"></iframe>
