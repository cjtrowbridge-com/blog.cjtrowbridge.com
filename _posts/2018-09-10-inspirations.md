[![Pieter Levels](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pieter-levels-2-2.jpg)](http://levels.io)Several figures are inspirations for this project. Chief among them is **[Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/open)**. His open revenue dashboard shows his several projects and monthly revenue, along with a graph. His dashboard also shows the status of many serverless bots which perform tasks to facilitate his projects. This enables him to be an effective solopreneur and digital nomad. [![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Andrey-Azimov-1-1.jpg)](https://www.andreyazimov.com/)**Andrey Azimov** is another interesting case, and a friend of Pieter Levels. I have been following his progress on a very similar open revenue dashboard [on his site](https://www.andreyazimov.com/). His dashboard also includes the interesting feature of an overall progress bar towards his MRR goal and a countdown to the deadline for his MRR goal. I think this is an interesting approach which could enable additional analytics about trends and progress.
