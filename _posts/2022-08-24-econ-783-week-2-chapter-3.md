    - Chapter 3: Demand Analysis
        - Summary
            - Demand relationships
            - Elasticity of demand
            - Cross elasticity of demand
            - Combined effect of demand elasticities
        - Demand Relationships
            - The demand schedule is the simplest form of the demand relationship. It is merely a list of prices and corresponding quantities of a product or service that would be demanded over a particular time period by some individual or group of individuals at uniform prices.

        - Constrained utility maximization
            - The concept of demand is based on the theory of consumer choice. Each consumer faces a constrained optimization problem, where the objective is to choose among the combinations of goods and services that maximize satisfaction or utility, subject to a constraining on the amount of funds (ie the household budget) available.
            - Purchasing power: when price of a good decreases, the purchasing power of the consumer has increased.
            - Substitution effects: when the price of a good decreases, it becomes less expensive in relation to other substitute goods, so the rational consumer can increase his or her satisfaction or utility by purchasing more of the good whose price has declined and less of the substitutes.
        - Determinants of demand
            - The customer's desired rate of purchase can be markedly affected not only by pricing but also by several other marketing decisions.
                - Income of buyers
                
                
                - Price of substitute goods
                
                
                - Tastes and preferences
                - Number of buyers
                - Expected future price
        - Price elasticity of demand
            - From a decision-making perspective, any firm needs to know not only the direction but also the magnitude effects of changes in the determinants of demand. Some of these factors are under the control of management, such as price, advertising, product quality, and customer service. Other demand determinantes, including disposable income and the prices of competitors' products are outside the direct control of the firm. Nevertheless, effective demand management still requires that a manager be able to measure the magnitude of the impact of changes in these other variables on quantity demanded.
            - The most commonly used measure of the responsiveness of quantity demanded of supplied to changes in any of the variables that influence the demand and supply functions is elasticity.
        - Price elasticity of demand
            - In general, elasticity should be thought of as a ratio of the percentage change in quantity to the percentage change in a determinant, ceteris paribus (all other things being held equal). Price elasticity of demand is therefore defined as

        - To better classify the different demand groups, we define the sensitivity of the consumers into the following ranges;

        - Price elasticity and sales revenue
            - The relationship between price elasticity and revenue can be derived graphically as well by analyzing the change in revenue resulting from a price change.

        - Elasticity-revenue relationship
            - Elasticity is often the key to marketing plans. A product-line manager will attempt to increase sales revenue by allocating a marketing expense budget among price promotions, advertising, retail displays, trade allowances, packaging, and direct mail, as well as in-store coupons. Knowing whether and at what magnitude demand is responsive to each of these marketing initiatives depends on careful estimates of the various demand elasticities of price, advertising, packaging, promotional displays, and so forth.
        - Factors affecting elasticity of demand
            - Several factors determine the responsiveness of the consumers demanding a good
                - Availability and closeness of substitutes
                - Percentage of the consumer's budget
                - Positioning as income superior
                - Time period of adjustment
