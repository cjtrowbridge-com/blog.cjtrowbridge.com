I was very proud this year to march with Sacramento's [Bolt Bar](https://www.facebook.com/boltbarsacramento/), a gay alternative bar which is a big participant in the leather and fetish communities in the Northern California area. The Bolt also hosts an annual Mr Leather competition whose winner goes on to [International Mr Leather](http://www.imrl.com/). ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/1528695806-1-1.jpg)I carried the Trans pride flag. This is an important and underserved group in the gay community. I am proud to do my part to support them as an ally.. ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pups-1-1.jpg) The truck that followed behind us as we marched towed a trailer containing a puppy mosh pit! Photo credit to my friend [Professor Scott Kirchner](https://www.facebook.com/scott.kirchner.18). It was very funny to see many dogs in the crowd reacting to the puppy mosh pit as though they were real dogs. I am still looking for photos or videos of those hilarious reactions. :\]
