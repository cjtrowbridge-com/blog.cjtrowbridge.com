These mountains come from Pangaea. They are actually older than bones! They are much smaller than the Rockies or even the Sierra or the Siskiyou where I’m from, but that’s only because they’ve been eroding for hundreds of millions of years! There is a road that follows the peaks with many amazing places to stop and take in the view. This is something I will never forget. > <iframe data-mce-fragment="1" name="__tt_embed__v70526533638741350" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/6948913236741786886?lang=en-US"></iframe>
