I dreamed of a man; a man who looked quite like myself. He was stacking bodies like bricks, building a wall to keep out the world, Bodies of the living and of the dead; lovers and foes alike. In between each, he added a layer of mortar made of equivocation and compromise. He spackled his wall-grave with all his mistakes to glue together the corpses and keep the world out.
