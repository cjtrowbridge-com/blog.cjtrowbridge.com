**<span class="">November 2nd and 4th </span><span class="">Session Twelve: Sustainable Urban Energy Management</span>** <span class="">This session will focus on the approaches, policies, and practices we can promote sustainable energy management and use. The discussion will be guided by the following questions:</span>1. <span class="">What are the major characteristics of energy?</span>
    - Energy: the ability to do work
    - Energy sources 
        - Human energy - both within and without the body
        - Animal energy - both within and without the body
        - Fossil fuels: remains of organic material that has died and been buried under pressure for millions of years. 
            - Petroleum: mostly used for transportation
            - Coal: mostly used outside transportation
            - Gas: mostly used outside transportation
        - Hydro/ Hydroelectric
        - Nuclear 
            - Fission
            - Fusion
        - Solar 
            - Thermal
            - Voltaic
        - Wind
        - Plants 
            - Bioremediation
            - Biomass
            - Biogas
        - Geothermal
        - Tidal power
    - Embodied energy: all the energy involved in doing work (cradle to cradle)
    - In the pre-industrial period, biomass was a main source of energy for the world 
        - Cooking
        - Heating
        - Transportation
        - Manufacturing
        - Extractive activities, consumptive activities, waste activities
    - Why did fossil fuels become popular? 
        - Fossil fuels are reliable 
            - Biomass burns at unpredictable temperatures
            - Hydro is also unpredictable as a direct energy source
            - Huge government subsidies
        - Fossil fuels are profitable
        - Example of glass blowers in Moreno in 14th century Venice switching from biomass to coal and doing more work but creating more pollution.
    - Coal is transported by rail
2. <span class="">What energy sources are used to provide energy in cities?</span>
    - Petroleum for transportation
    - Fossil fuels like gas and biomass for heat
    - Some solar and wind
3. <span class="">What do we mean by the concept “renewable energy”?</span>
    -
4. <span class="">What energy systems and technologies are considered “renewable” and why are they considered renewable?</span>
    - Wind
    - Solar
    - Hydroelectric
    - These are considered to be renewable because the externalities are largely priced in, and the sources work for a long time without producing additional harms once they are in place.
5. <span class="">What economic and social policies would need to be implemented to promote widespread use of renewable energy?</span>
    - Government subsidies need to change to support renewable energy instead of non-renewable energy
    - Political support for corporate accountability
    - Infrastructure
    - Research and development
    - Trade policies to support materials and manufacturing related to the production of renewable energy sources
    - Reduce consumption and increase efficiency
6. <span class="">Which countries are at the forefront of using renewable energy; what can we learn from these countries?</span>
    - Norway, France, Denmark, China, Iceland, Germany, Holland, Sweden
    - We should install renewable sources and use policies that encourage renewable energy consumption in transportation, manufacturing, and other energy consumption sectors
7. <span class="">How can professionals promote sustainable energy management and use?</span>
    - Transitioning to renewables can have a harmful impact 
        - Our consumption is very high, while many developing nations have very low consumption. We need both groups to move towards a more sustainable central level of consumption. So developing nations need to consume more in order to reach a parity of living conditions while developed nations need to consume less.
        - Infrastructure investments for developing nations to help them skip ahead and adopt better alternatives to fossil fuel energy sources
    - Job training 
        - For example for workers to stop working on coal and start working on solar

#### Other Notes

- The global south is largely not electrified
- In non-electrified areas, open fires use biomass for cooking, heat, manufacturing 
    - The smoke people are exposed to can be equivalent to six packs of cigarettes per day 
        - Respiratory diseases are a far more serious threat because of this
- Around the world, the industrialization of developing nations has given wealth benefits to the elites and health harms to the common people
- Infrastructure is often funded by international banks 
    - Bonds are a good alternative funding source for infrastructure which allows them to avoid the political and economic interference from the international banking system
