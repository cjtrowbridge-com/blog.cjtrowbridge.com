What unique benefits does this company/product deliver and who are your 1,000 true fans? How can I turn my casual fans into die-hard fans? "Focus on what fucking matters and let the rest follow." These are the fundamental questions he asks through his three rules of branding. This is a really great episode about differentiating and the value of ignoring branding. There is a lot of practical, tactical information. I will revisit this episode many times. Oddly, I was not able to find this episode on his website, but I did find it [on Player.fm](https://player.fm/series/the-tim-ferriss-show-1578275/269-the-3-critical-rules-of-branding).
