[![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/rhonda-patrick-1-1.png)](http://tim.blog/2017/05/04/smart-drugs-fasting-and-fat-loss/)This episode has an unbelievable amount of information. The Guest is Dr. Rhonda Patrick, who Tim describes as, "an American biochemist and scientist." She has done extensive research and work in the fields of the cellular biology, genetics, nutrition, and nootropics. She views aging as a disease to be treated, and elaborates in depth on all of these topics. There were a few big takeaways right off the bat; - Regular sauna use is really really good for you, for a huge number of well researched reasons.
- There is a tremendous amount of research around the influence of genetics on nutrition, and the fact that nutrition works differently for everyone. Having recently [synthesized my genome](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2017/03/26/23andme-my-genes/) with [23AndMe](http://refer.23andme.com/v2/share/6403008858372551306), I was very interested in her comments about various services which will allow you to bring over your genome for dietary analysis. This is something I will need to look in to.
- Nootropics or any drugs which work by prevent reuptake in the brain cause down-regulation, or the reduced capacity of the brain to deal with normal levels of those neurotransmitters. She goes in depth into the implications of this and her conclusions about how to use those.
- NSAIDs are really really bad for you. I had no idea about the mountain of recent research linking them to everything from stroke to heart attacks. As someone who takes them almost every day, I will certainly stop doing that. She suggests several great, healthy, natural alternatives.
- [Sulforaphane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulforaphane) is very important and I should eat a lot more of it, (ie. Broccoli). It is very important for many cellular processes which prevent and repair the damage that leads to aging. It also drives the growth of new neurons and body systems which ward off insects.
- She goes in depth into her experience with nootropics and dietary supplements and the ones she takes every day. I will need to look further into these.

##### **Fasting and time-restricted diets are very good for cells and for fighting the kind of damage that leads to aging.**

Fasting makes your body consume sick cells for energy at a much higher rate than normal, decreasing the chances for cancer and improving the function of the tissues and organs composed of these cells. This goes hand in hand with cellular genesis, or the creation of new cells which also speeds up during fasting. These new cells are more efficient and functional than the old, less-functional cells which are converted to energy. Research also shows that animals which eat during a smaller window like 10 hours per day have pervasive improvements in function of systems all over the body from the mitochondria to the digestive system. In tests with mice, this also leads to up to 20% longer lifespan. There was way too much information to absorb in a continuous stream. A few minutes in, I found myself enumerating the lenses I would need to re-listen through: - Nootropics and other good supplements
- Fasting and time-restricted eating
- Cellular health and rejuvenation and its impact on cognitive performance and long-term decline

 I will be re-listening to this episode a number of times in the next few months and expanding on this post. For now, it has inspired me to start eating during a smaller window, for now just ten hours. This is the largest window she says will likely still confer the benefits of time-restricted diet.
