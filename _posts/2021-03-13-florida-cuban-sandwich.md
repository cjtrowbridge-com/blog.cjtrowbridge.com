(View the full album here) This was a really amazing sandwich, though kind of terrifying experience to actually get the sandwichâ€¦ <video autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1" height="150" preload="" width="300"></video> I have had Cuban Sandwiches before but this was much better. I read somewhere that there is something about the way they prepare the ham in traditional cuban sandwiches that is different and better. I definitely sensed that, plus there seemed to be something special about the pickles. Very delicious sandwich.
