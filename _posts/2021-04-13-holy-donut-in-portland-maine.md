Like any good Portland, Portland, Maine has a popular local donut shop called Holy Donut. I tried the Mixed Berry, Sea Salt and Chocolate, and the Maple Bacon donuts. They were all delicious. I have never had a salt and chocolate donut before. I will keep an eye out for similar flavors in the future.
