Next we stopped at Cosanti in Phoenix on the way to Saguaro National Park. This is where Soleri lived and worked while he was building Arcosanti. They still do a lot of similar bronze and ceramics work at Cosanti today just like Arcosanti. Here is the ceramics working apse at Cosanti. The tunnel at the back is pretty cool. It leads to another courtyard. This is one of his earliest apses and I havenâ€™t seen any other examples where there was a tunnel in the back like this. It seems like an homage to Frank Lloyd Wright because the tunnel starts out very low and gradually expands into the apse, giving the impression of a much larger space.

This is just like my [chemistry honors project](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2019/11/20/data-are-shiftpods-actually-cooler/) from several years ago.
