- 3¼ cups gluten free flour ([I like Cup4Cup](https://amzn.to/44vtcEg))\*
- 1 tbsp granulated sugar
- 2 tsp salt
- 1 packet (2 tsp) rapid rise instant yeast ([I like Fleischmann's](https://amzn.to/3K7ieMV))\*
- 2½ cups soy milk (Soy milk is best for baking)
- 4 tbsp butter, melted

<div></div><div>Mix all the ingredients in a mixer for 5 minutes on medium.</div><div></div><div>Put it in a large bowl. Cover and let sit for at least two hours to rise. Fine to refrigerate after that.</div><div></div><div>I have used this basic bread recipe and adapted it to make all kinds of things from cupcakes to Foccacia.</div><div></div><div></div><div>Note: **THIS WILL STICK**. Spray the pan with cooking spray before baking.</div><div></div>## For Cupcakes

- Add one cup of sugar and one tablespoon of Mexican vanilla before mixing
- Pour it into cupcake cups.
- Bake at 400 for 20-25 minutes.
- You will know it's done when you can stick a toothpick in it and it comes out dry.
- Add frosting and preferably dinosaur sprinkles.

## For Foccacia

- Layer it thin in the pan
- Drizzle with olive oil
- Add toppings 
    - Try fig and prosciutto with parmigiano reggiano
    - Or rosemary and kalamata olive with parmigiano reggiano
