This is a free tool based on several other tools I have seen online. It accepts long-form text and condenses it to the length you specify. The code is very simple, and very powerful. I was shocked at how easy this was to build. Check it out on [Github](https://github.com/cjtrowbridge/Condensr), or head over to the site and [start condensing](https://condensr.io/)!

## Next Steps

I have started initial development of an API, and I want to add a feed of things people have Condensed as well as a bookmarlet tool for condensing news articles.
