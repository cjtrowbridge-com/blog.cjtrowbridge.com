This is easily one of my favorite books. This was my first time reading it, and I found that I had to take breaks to reflect, and often reread chapters before moving on. Very excellent work by Gibson. I can see the way his thoughts moved in the direction of [Neuromancer](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2014/10/17/neuromancer/) towards the end and then led into that series. [Burning Chrome](https://amzn.to/3fdAV0c) is an anthology of short science fiction stories, some of which are set in the same universe and some of which are not. One of the stories is set inside a future soviet space program. One is about The Edge which figures heavily in Count Zero. Yet another is set in cyberspace and has had a dramatic effect on the way I imagine cyberspace and cyberpunk more broadly. [![Burning Chrome](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Burning_chrome-1-1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/3fdAV0c)Anyone who likes science fiction should read this book. Anyone who loves cyberpunk MUST read this book. 10/10
