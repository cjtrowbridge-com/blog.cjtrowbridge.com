***This is part of a series on [Building 12 Startups in 12 Months](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/category/the-levels-challenge-build-12-startups-in-12-months/).***

***This is product number three: [CronPUT](https://cronput.com/)!***

[CronPUT](https://cronput.com/) is a fairly self-explanatory name. Users log in with Google to sign up for an account and enter a list of webhook URLs, specifying an interval for each. At the specified time, a PUT request is sent to the URL. You can even see the result header code. I maintain a dozen or so Linux servers. Keeping track of cron jobs for that many high-entropy webhooks is insane when they are all in different places and may or may not be working. This product solves this problem by putting all your cron webhooks in one place.
