- Icebreaker discussion
    - Online classes can seem impersonal, especially if they are asynchronous. Let's see what we can do together to change that! I've provided a brief intro, but now it's your turn! Please introduce yourself in the forum and respond to something in at least two others' forum posts 
        - What name (and pronouns) would you prefer to be addressed by?
        - Where are you currently located (and what time zone is that, if not Pacific Time)?
        - Can you think of an operations problem you've faced in your job or personal life (for example as a shopper)?
        - What are you most interested in learning about in this course?
        - If you plan on doing the extra credit labs, and if you want to group up, let people know what days and times (in Pacific Time) are best for you. If you don't (or want to do them solo) that's okay, too.

    - Many new companies focus on service-oriented versions of products which were historically manufactured, in order to pursue recurring revenue. Ie software as a service rather than a one-time purchase.
