 <article class="post-13838 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-2021-winter" id="post-13838"><div class="entry-content">Hot Springs is a small town in Arkansas. It’s also a National Park. It’s very strange as far as national parks go, to have the park and town mixed together like this. There is no entrance fee for example and the visitor center is a shop in the town. <video autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1" height="150" preload="" width="300"></video>The only hot springs are indoors. The main street of the town has dozens of enormous and elaborate bath houses where you can go to bathe in the hot spring water. Unfortunately, no one in Arkansas has ever heard of a mask, so I did not feel safe going into any of the bath houses to actually bathe in the hot springs water. It’s a cute town, and a cute part of a boring state. I think I might come visit again to see what it’s like sans pandemic, but overall it seems like basically just a normal hot springs town; like [Mammoth](https://movingcabin.com/static/index.html@p=13575.html) but more expensive and less scenic. </div><footer class="entry-footer"></footer></article>
