An app that allows you to create simple interfaces for interacting with APIs. Then share the interface deal through a marketplace. I know it sounds like Astria but it's not the same. Imagine there is a website or app that people use, and they want to intercede in the connection between their computer and that endpoint. This would be a way of creating a man in the middle for yourself and choosing to control, change, or prevent whatever packets or information you choose. So someone might make one for a game which makes it easy to get control of the internal client/server communications. Like maybe you are playing a game you like, but that game has a lot of ads so you go on the marketplace and someone has made a plug-in that lets you block ads for that game at the network level.
