"Individuals who fight to change the established social order sometimes face the possibility of being labeled deviantâ€”and even mentally ill. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, for instance, women in Britain who demonstrated for women's right to vote were widely viewed to be mentally ill. When a person's or a group's behavior challenges social expectations, we must open our minds to the possibility that such actions are in fact an adaptive response to injustice. People may justifiably challenge what everyone thinks is true and may express ideas that seem strange. **They should be able to make others feel uncomfortable without being labeled abnormal**."
