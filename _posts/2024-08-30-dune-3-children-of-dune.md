This book was hard to read. The author's extreme misogyny and homophobia become central themes in the story. As does his explicit endorsement and justification of intergenerational relationships which really cross moral boundaries. Nevertheless, the narrative form and conclusion of most of the storylines from the beginning of the series give this book a satisfying ending. This is a story about mission creep, institutional bloat, organizational decay, corruption, and the way things come crashing down. It's also a story about how to navigate that process to one's own benefit, if perhaps not in a very realistic way. I listened to the last chapter several times.
