([You can view the full album here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/zQDgvi4kwi9K8ou86)) I know what you’re thinking. You stopped at Yosemite in between Texas and Florida? Well yes but there are three reasons. First, I had to get my car smogged in California. Second, Texas was a fucking mess at this point. Third, the firefalls! ![Yosemite National Park](https://i2.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Yosemite-National-Park.jpg?resize=780%2C439&ssl=1)Also I was lucky enough to go with my whole family plus my podmate Joe who I haven’t seen since [Taos](https://movingcabin.com/static/index.html@p=13728.html)! ![Family portrait](https://i1.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Family-portrait.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1)It was a great time. Yosemite is really something. I will definitely go back. ![Joe and CJ](https://i1.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Joe-and-CJ.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1)The firefalls were not that impressive but what can you do ![‍♀️](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/svg/1f937-200d-2640-fe0f.svg)![Yosemite Firefalls](https://i1.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Yosemite-Firefalls.jpg?resize=780%2C1040&ssl=1)
