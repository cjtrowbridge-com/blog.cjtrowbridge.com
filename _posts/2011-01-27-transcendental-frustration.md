In life there are moments when the course of an entire interpersonal relationship takes place in just a few seconds and yet it's so poignant that you remember it for years. Appreciating a glance, a laugh, a smile from a perfect stranger is a big part of life. Knowing that you'll walk away and never see that person again makes it all the more vivid a memory. Trust me when I say you can choose to build your life around these moments and nothing more.

</div><div>Then there are other relationships which transcend the moments. Those three or four people you keep in touch with over the years and go to with your problems and frustrations.</div><div>  
</div><div>I'm 22. I've lived in a lot of places and met a lot of people. I look back with a fond nostalgia on a true plethora of moments. Soooo much has happened, and I carry so little of it with me. But those three or four people who I do carry with me affect me on a level I can't really explain. I miss them so much that I sometimes ask myself if I should pick up and go find them. But they're all in different places and in the end they've all grown since I knew them and it probably wouldn't be the same. But I can't help but miss those best few friends who've become forever a part of me.</div>
