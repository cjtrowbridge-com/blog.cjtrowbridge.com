[Lying by Sam Harris](https://amzn.to/2XPFfwO) makes the argument for radical honesty. This is an interested book which is very different from his previous books, but connects to them on the theme of reasonable and rational discussion of their topics. Religion, he seems to imply, can only exist in a world where people are comfortable lying to themselves and others. His actual argument in this book is simply that we should be honest, and that it's always better to be honest.
