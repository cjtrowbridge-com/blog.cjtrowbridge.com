<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">#### Academics

- **Khan: Complete Algebra Review**
    - I will review algebra and then test into the courses I need for my degree. *This will be a higher priority once I am done with working at Tech 2U and I am able to devote more time to education.*
- **Khan: Complete Trigonometry**
    - I will complete trigonometry online in order to skip extraneous classes and finish my transfer credits soon.
    - Depending on how this experience goes, I may want to take more of my math classes on Khan rather than at school.
- **Xfer =&gt; PSU/SDSU**
    - I will transfer to PSU or SDSU to complete my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.

It's so easy, and so profitable. I will put this higher on my list of priorities once I get caught up.*
