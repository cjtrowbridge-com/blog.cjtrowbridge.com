"Michelle Tugade, Barbara Fredrickson, and Lisa Feldman Barrett (2004) found that the **superior coping of resilient individuals came from their ability to use positive emotions to spring back from negative emotional experiences**. Using measures of cardiovascular activity, the researchers discovered that resilient individuals were better able to regulate their responses to stressful situations (for instance, being told they were about to give an important speech) by strategically experiencing positive emotion."
