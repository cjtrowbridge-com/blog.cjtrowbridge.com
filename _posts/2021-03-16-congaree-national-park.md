([View the full album here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/wXbcz459j32wAcqZ9)) This one is really just a spite park. It was created to prevent development in the area. It’s just a normal forest with hiking. There isn’t really anything remarkable about it. <video autoplay="autoplay" controls="controls" data-mce-fragment="1" height="150" preload="" width="300"></video>They were also doing prescribed burns so the trails were closed. lmao. So basically it was just a parking lot with burned forest around it. Not the most memorable park so far.
