****February 24th** **Session Five: Alternative Business, Housing, and Food Ownership Models and Structures****

 ****I Alternative Business Ownership Structures: Worker Owned Cooperative Businesses****

****Worker-owned cooperatives are businesses that are owned and managed by their workers. Although there are variations, typically, each worker owns a share and all shares are owned by the workers. The infrastructure of worker-owned cooperatives differs, as control by worker-owners can be performed through individual, collective, or majority ownership. Research on worker-owned cooperatives shows that they are often more efficient and productive, and that workers have much higher levels of satisfaction and pride in their company and work.****
