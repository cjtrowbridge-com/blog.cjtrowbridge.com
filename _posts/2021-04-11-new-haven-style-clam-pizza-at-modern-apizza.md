For this one, I reached out to several people including current and former Yale students in order to find out the best local place to get the best local food. As someone who grew up in a Norwegian family where fermented fish is considered a delicacy, Iâ€™m not a huge seafood fan. But part of this trip is me getting to try new things to fall in love with, and several of the local seafood delicacies on the east coast jumped out at me. Check out the video to see the pizza and my reaction!
