[![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/sapiens-1-1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2Eg2sxB)This book covers big history from the big bang to today, with an emphasis on our species, and the other species of humans who we originally coexisted with. The book covers theories about what happened to our cousins, as well as what happened to every ecosystem we moved into. The book goes on to talk about the rise of cultures and civilizations, why they evolved the way they did, and why there is no going back. You can use this link to **[get the book for free](https://amzn.to/2Eg2sxB)** if you don't already have an Audible account. ## Big Takeaways

- We have changed a lot in our short history, and there is no going back.
- Most of the issues we are preoccupied with are pointless and transient.
- Syncretism: All the cultures and religions of today are a blend of many previous ones as well as of their competing religions and cultures..
