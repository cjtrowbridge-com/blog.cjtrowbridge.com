[The End of Faith](https://amzn.to/2XKYaJd) was Sam Harris' first book. He published it while he was still a graduate student. This book is an excellent indictment of Christianity in America and the many externalities it perpetrates on the world. [![The End of Faith by Sam Harris](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/The_End_of_Faith-1-1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2XKYaJd)I think if I had read this book twenty years ago, it would have had a dramatic impact on my intellectual journey. As it stands, I already agree with essentially every point he makes. Still, it was a good read that will help me to consider deeper rebuttals of Christianity and its arguments.
