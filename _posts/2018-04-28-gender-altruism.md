"Women are more likely than men to help when the context involves existing interpersonal relationships or nurturing, such as volunteering time to help a child with a personal problem (Eagly, 2009). Men, on the other hand, are more likely to help in situations in which a perceived danger is present (for instance, picking up a hitchhiker) and in which they feel competent to help (as in assisting someone with a flat tire) (Eagly &amp; Crowley, 1986)."
