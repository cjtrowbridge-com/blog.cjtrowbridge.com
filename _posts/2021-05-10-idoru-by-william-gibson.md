"What is this place? A communal site, right? But what are you so worried about? Why's it all a secret?" "Walled City is of the net, but not on it. There are no laws here, only agreements." "You can't be on the net and not be on the net," Chia said, as they shot up a final flight of stairs. "Distributed processing," he said. "Interstitial, It began with a shared killfile-"
