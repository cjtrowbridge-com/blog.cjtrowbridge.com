For the last year, I have been a student who consistently takes at least a double to triple full-time workload. I am not superman, but I do have a 4.0 GPA. I also spend a great deal of my time traveling and having vacations and adventures. All of this has been an intensely complex effort, but several simple tools have made all the difference. Three tools in particular have dramatically improved my ability to accomplish this enormous undertaking.

#### Rate My Professor

I hear a lot of criticism of this platform, and a lot of it is probably true, but it has never steered me wrong. I have a simple rule; I will not take any class where the professor has less than a 4/5 rating. As we will see, this makes all the difference. #### LMS

These days, every college is going to require their teachers to use a learning management system. Any decent professor is going to be able to understand and properly implement their LMS. Canvas has been great, though it's not perfect. Probably most any modern LMS will work for my system. An LMS is very helpful but not necessarily critical to managing a large workload. # Organizing The Data

![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot-2018-06-18-at-11.03.28-AM-1-1.png)I start by making a bookmarks folder for the semester. Then I put a link in it for each class. The links go to the grades section of each class. This way, I will skip pointless details and go straight to a list of any incomplete assignments whenever I check on a class. # Time Management

Now that it is easy to see all the tasks which I will need to complete, it's time to put them all in one place. I start by creating an appointment in my calendar every monday morning called "Check for Coursework." A good rule of thumb is to start with the first week, and see how long it takes to go through all the classes and find assignments. I usually spend about an hour or two checking every class for any assignments and then entering everything. Once you know how long that will take you, create a recurring calendar event each week for this purpose. Each class will also require some fairly consistent amount of time to complete all its coursework. I usually assume about two hours per class per week for completing assignments. **It is absolutely critical** that time is set aside for each class. Problems and distractions are going to come up. If I ever need to move my coursework time to later in the week, I know how long it's going to take and whether that's going to be possible because I have created a block of time for each class. Here's what an average week this summer looks like; ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Capture-1-1.png)In grey is all my classes and the time set aside for completing assignments. In blue, my personal plans and events I'm going to. In yellow, tasks I need to complete which are not at a specific time. In red, I have time set aside for sleep. This is another important thing to remember. Getting enough sleep every night is critical to performing on this level. You're no good to yourself or anybody else if you're half asleep. # Triage

Maybe the most important step in my process is creating a fresh to-do list every week for school. I love [Trello](https://trello.com/) for this purpose, a great recommendation from [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/). It's a great, free tool that lets you make to-do lists. It also features integration with [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) which will be super handy in a few minutes. It's Monday morning so this is what my Trello board looks like... ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot-2018-06-18-at-11.29.15-AM-1-1.png)The first column is titled with the date on which the week starts. The second column contains anything I need to finish today. The third column contains any school tasks which I have not completed yet, but which need to be done this week. In the past, I would go through all my classes and create entries in Trello for anything I need to finish this week. Then, I will use that time I blocked off in my calendar to work on each class until everything is done. **BUT THERE'S A MAGICAL SHORTCUT!**# IFTTT

I love IFTTT. I use it for tons of home automation and other fun projects. But it's not all fun and games. In this case, it can put all my coursework into my todo list for me! The Canvas LMS is what both of my colleges are using right now, and it has a feature which most LMS will probably have. It gives you a URL which lets you add your assignment due-dates to your calendar. I added this URL to my Google Calendar, and then connected Trello and Google Calendar to IFTTT. Then it was as simple as creating this applet which automatically adds anything in that calendar to Trello as a new item in my "School" list. Here are the settings I used: ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/IFTTT-to-Trello-1-1.png)To summarize, any time any of my professors at either college creates an assignment, it is automatically inserted into my school to-do list on Trello. Note that I left the "Description" field blank because it adds a lot of unnecessary extra information. I just want the name of the assignment and the due date. With this incredible automation in place, I spend my coursework time on Mondays simply cleaning up complex assignment names and putting things in order of how I want to complete them. Here's what my Trello board looks like after this process... ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Screenshot-2018-06-18-at-11.40.18-AM-1-1.png)# Final Thoughts

With these tools in place, I am able to take double and triple full-time workloads without worrying about missing things or whether I will have time to complete the work. I already know exactly how much time I will need and when that time fits into my week. I know everything that's due and I rank it in order of when I want to get it done. Probably a lot of the inspiration for this process came from reading [Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/), [Pieter Levels](https://levels.io/), and others on similar processes for maximizing impact while minimizing work at startups. It's funny to me how much of our time we spend worrying about the workload instead of actually doing the work. When you eliminate that anxiety by building a foolproof structure around your work, it's easy to maximize what you can get done.
