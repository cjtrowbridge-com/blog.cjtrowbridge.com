While driving Uber, I recently gave a man a ride to his hotel from a business dinner. He told me he was an investment banker visiting from Chicago and asked if I had any investments. I told him about my strategy of trading Gold ETFs on volatility and asked for input on it. He said it sounded like a great idea, if I stick to metrics like RSI as I sometimes do, and further suggested I could diversify by looking for buying opportunities in other commodities as well. To that end, I created [stocks.cjtrowbridge.com](https://stocks.cjtrowbridge.com/) which shows six different groups of ETFs with both bull and bear options along with their current RSI and some automated analysis to find which one might be the best buying opportunity on a given day. I am working on expanding this tool to offer signups for automated daily emails. Stay tuned and let me know what you think!
