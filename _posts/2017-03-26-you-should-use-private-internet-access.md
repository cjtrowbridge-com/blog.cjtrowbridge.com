[![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pia-1-1.jpg)Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/trowbridge) took out a full page ad in the New York Times at enormous cost to let people know about this important issue. Just one more reason I am proud to give them $5/mo for security and privacy online. They are a really really great vpn service which allows all your devices to have a very secure, private connection which protects you against unsafe public wifi or unscrupulous internet service providers. The Evil Orange Empire wants to let these people sell all your information, but you can stand up to them with [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/trowbridge)! If you want your internet activity to be safe from your ISP selling your information and fucking with your content, I highly recommend signing up for [Private Internet Access](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/pages/buy-vpn/trowbridge).
