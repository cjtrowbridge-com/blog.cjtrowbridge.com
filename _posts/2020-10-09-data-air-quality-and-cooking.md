I was curious what cooking does to air quality and nuclear radiation. We know that cooking meats releases naturally occurring radioactive materials just like [wildfires do](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/08/25/data-nuclear-radiation-and-wildfires/). For the curious, I was cooking bulgogi. As you can see, at 1:30 when I started cooking, there was a huge spike in the indoor air pollution in my home. In fact this level of indoor air pollution does qualify as "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups" under the [international standard](https://aqicn.org/faq/2013-09-09/revised-pm25-aqi-breakpoints/). ![Bulgogi](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bulgogi-1-1.png) Now let's look at the nuclear radiation aspect of cooking. This is less cut and dry... ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Geiger-1-1.png)My [sensors](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/09/11/multpurpose-apocalypse-sensors-v3/) measure only beta and gamma decay, not alpha. These kinds of radiation have only moderate penetrating power, and so we would expect to see a lower level indoors with less change over time. The higher outdoor level comes from both solar radiation and [the norms](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/08/25/data-nuclear-radiation-and-wildfires/) radiated by the wildfires. This data is the hourly average for Geiger cpm readings taken every minute. As you can see, despite a decrease in the ambient radiation levels measured outside, there was a slight increase in indoor radiation levels.
