This quickly became one of my all-time favorites. After I heard its TV adaptation called "The best scifi since Firefly," I had to give it a shot. The first season of the show takes you about halfway through this first book in the series... ![Leviathan_Wakes_(first_edition)](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Leviathan_Wakes_first_edition-1-465x731.jpg)In true space-opera fashion, it follows a group of people loosely connected to some big events going on in human civilization. I am a big fan of cyberpunk themes and futuristic realism. Nothing ruins scifi for me like magic. This story walks the line but firmly stays within the realm of the possible. I almost always do audiobooks because of an eye-muscle problem I have. More than a few times, I stayed in the car in the driveway not ready to stop because the story was so good. Every night before bed, I would keep adding time to the sleep timer on the app because I couldn't "put it down." Anyone who likes scifi or cyberpunk should check this out, and check out the show too! I give it a 10/10. Can't wait to finish the series!
