([You can view the full album here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/JTzGKF6AAK96rbbH8)) Big Bend is also basically just normal mountains. There is no cave or anything. Again it’s kind of unusual to have mountains in this area so that’s cool. Also it’s very pretty to look at, but again not really anything unique or special aside from the nice scenery. ![Big Bend National Park](https://i2.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/IMG_20210220_190933_419.jpg?resize=780%2C780&ssl=1)When you come into the park, it’s like a big circle of mountains with a valley inside, and that’s the park. Right in the center of the valley there is a small group of tall mountains where the visitor center is. .. ![Big Bend Center](https://i0.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Big-Bend-Center.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1)On the way into Big Bend National Park, I passed a [random Prada store](https://www.instagram.com/p/CLfiNBaBk37/) in the middle of nowhere. As it turns out, this is a public art project called [Prada Marfa](https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/prada-marfa). Marfa is a cute little bohemian town full of beer gardens and kitch trailer parks. I would love to visit Marfa sometime sans pandemic. Not sure if I would want to go back to Big Bend.
