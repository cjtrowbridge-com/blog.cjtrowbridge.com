As the finish line approaches, I have noticed issues with several of the older projects in the list. Maintaining them seems pointless unless I plan on actually using them, so I am removing some of the projects from production while I focus on completing the last items on the list. These will also have met with limited interest from test marketing. <del>Startup 9: What are you wearing today?</del><del>Startup 8: Stardate.Today</del><del>Startup 7: Top Story Review</del><del>Startup 6: Exotic Weapons</del>Startup 5: Condensr Startup 4: CronPUT <del>Startup 3: Draupnr</del><del>Startup 2: RSI Alert</del><del>Startup 1: Securities Science</del>All of these are still available on Github if anyone wants to check out the code or clone and reactivate them. The RSI Alert project in particular has found a following and I'm sorry to disappoint the few dedicated users who are interested in this project. Feel free to fork the repo and take it over if you'd like! :\] Three projects left!
