    - Community Ready Corps and The Anti Police-Terror Project convened a wide range of Black leaders in Oakland gathered virtually to develop a set of demands in terms of what we expect of our City's response to this crisis
    - WE, as the Descendants of Slaves, Black, African American organized in order to force acknowledgement of the impact of this crisis on the Black community to forge a path forward to health, demand equitable treatment from all public, local and state government and to establish a space for Black voices at all tables that plan around, impact and shape our lives.
    - Black people are not suffering at higher rates of COVID-19 because we are “lazy” or “unhealthy”. We are suffering at higher rates as a direct result of 500 years of discriminatory treatment. East and West Oakland have the worst air quality in the City of Oakland, we have the least access to healthy food, the least access to quality education and jobs and face the most discrimination by city policy and policymakers.
    - The disproportionate impact on Black people demands a disproportionate response - most of the resources must be given/directed to the greatest need. 
        - Publish desegregated data by race and zip code to properly track spread and to inform allocation of resources.
        - No person, company or entity should be allowed to profit off of a pandemic. Nor should the city of Oakland direct COVID disaster funding towards ongoing development plans without being informed by relevant data to support those decisions as being a science based response to the pandemic.
        - No government can place a demand on a people without incurring responsibility for the costs those demands will exact – free masks for all, testing, retesting, contact tracing and healthcare, internet access, etc.
        - Reparations for Black people, who as a demographic are disproportionately affected in this moment as a result of historic structural, institutional, and systemic racism
    - TESTING, PUBLIC HEALTH, AND PATIENT RIGHTS: 
        - To have free, full, accessible testing and retesting sites, both walk-up and drive-through, in East and West Oakland and at encampments throughout Oakland.
        - Supply 500,000 reusable face masks and 500,000 bottles of hand sanitizer to the African American community.
        - Give anyone of African or African American ancestry priority status for testing, the same as medical personnel, first responders, and essential workers.
        - Black maternal health and birth workers’ rights are prioritized to offer greater safety and better outcomes for Black mothers and babies.
        - Better resource the already culturally competent and accessible clinics in East and West Oakland, with funds to enable them to buy tests and offer unlimited testing.
        - Data is collected and that the race of all people impacted and the outcomes of their interaction with COVID 19 such as hospitalization, ventilation, or death, are recorded and desegregated by zip code.
        - Ventilation and other care for COVID 19 not be denied due to anti-Blackness.
        - Systemic racism be addressed, through both short and long term solutions, as a root cause of the disproportionate impact of COVID 19 on Black people.
        - Alameda County to scale up their overall testing capacity, as more testing sites are needed countywide, including in many hospitals such as Highland Hospital.
        - All people are entitled to free masks, testing, contact tracing, and care - especially people who are currently incarcerated, living in congregate living situations, and newly released and entering into a living situation with family and/or other people.
        - Consistent best practices put in place, monitored, and enforced in all congregant living spaces that house vulnerable minority populations in danger of being infected by staff or one another, mass death due to lack of intentional care should be considered as a threat to life.
        - An end to all permits regarding potential pollutants in opportunity zones, closures for non-essential businesses that impact the environment, and concrete action on factors contributing to a toxic environment in Oakland.
        - Free healthcare and access to testing, including antibody testing, for all people.
        - Testing and a policy concerning containment at transitional homes.
        - Specific, relevant and community-led mental health resources for Black people to be made free, accessible and available to all, including grief support for people who have endured loss due to COVID 19 and beyond.
    - EDUCATION AND FAMILIES: 
        - A moratorium on school closures and co-locations in Oakland.
        - Universal passage of all students during this time due to lack of technology equity and redistribution of resources to ensure that all students have access to what they need.
        - Measures to increase access to the internet including buses with wifi in neighborhoods to provide internet access and making internet a public utility to ensure access for all.
        - Shelter, housing protections, and healthcare for all students and their families.
        - No criminalization of youth in Oakland related to COVID 19 precautions such as wearing a mask, etc.
        - Investment in community schools once students return, with wraparound services such as health clinics, nurses, mental health services, food for students and families.
        - Divest in school police departments altogether and invest instead in health services, arts and culture programming, and student supports.
        - Recognize the difficulty of distance learning for many students and create accessible resources. All students should have equal access.
        - Hold a fair vote for the school board that is open to youth.

        - Deferral of current payments and taxes for Black businesses and forgiveness of debts.
        - Requirement of the city to contract specifically with Black businesses in order to provide much-needed income.
        - Small businesses with fewer than 500 employees to receive no interest loans, reimbursements, and debt forgiveness.
        - Right to return requirement to combat systemic racism for all employees.
        - Community oversight body to ensure that “return to normal” does not usher in a new era of even more violent capitalism and greater dispossession for Black people and businesses.
        - Transparency around the cruise ship that docked in Oakland and the impacts on the workers, as well as free healthcare and testing for all workers who were exposed and their families. And any other major events that jeopardize the health and safety of workers, and communities—the right to know.
        - The ability to declare and receive compensation for a standby for health and safety.
        - Right to return for workers who are laid off and right to stay for workers who do not want to leave their jobs. And right to return to those who elect to protect their health in a pandemic.
        - Protection for Black union leaders.
        - Congress should create a supplementary direct assistance program for the self-employed and microbusinesses to help cover the cost of lost business, paid sick leave, individual health care costs, and fixed expenses.
        - Self-employed Americans depend on critical e-commerce infrastructure, including financial services, shipping, and Internet connectivity. The federal government should ensure that these essential services remain fully operational, even as the public and private sectors take greater measures to contain the spread of the virus.
        - PPES mandatory for all Frontline and essential workers. State/County/City should make them available to employers at cost. Currently they have to get them at retail this is an additional cost they can’t afford.
        - Employers should receive subsidies as an incentive to protect their workers.
        - Unemployment Insurance rates should not increase because of COVID layoffs – rates should stay flat.
        - Workers compensation insurance should be covered for employers so that they do not take a hit when workers are out sick with COVID 19.
        - Congress should expand Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) by increasing the income threshold (which is dependent on a number of factors), including younger and childless workers, and eliminating the marriage penalty. Lawmakers should also allow it to be calculated and administered on a quarterly basis instead of annually, which would better support individuals struggling to manage short-term income volatility.
        - The City of Oakland and the County of Alameda should help facilitate a local Small Business Relief fund. The fund will be Hosted by The California Endowment, the Small Business Relief Fund to provide immediate support to struggling self-employed and small business owners. TCE will partner with Opportunity Fund, California’s largest nonprofit microlender, to ensure critical capital remains available to these entities throughout this crisis.
        - Six-month income replacement program conditioned upon full and continued employment of all restaurant staff, payment of rents to landlords, and ongoing payables to suppliers.
        - Provide rent abatement for the duration of the administrative closure followed by percentage rent through 2020 for tenants. This must be coupled with mortgage forgiveness for landlords.
