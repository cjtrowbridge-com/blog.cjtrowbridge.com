Amazon is starting to introduce their own versions of more products. These "Amazon Basics" are everything from electronics to office supplies, home goods and groceries. These new products are lower-cost and higher profit than their other offerings, and signal a paradigm shift for Amazon. They took over the world of online retail by selling other people's products. And now that the world is theirs, they want to sell their own cheaper alternatives to other people's products. The vast majority of analysts rate amazon a "Strong Buy" according to reporting from Nasdaq, with an average price target of $792, well within its 12-month range. The stock is currently trading at $702, a 12% projected gain. I will bet +5/-2.5%.
