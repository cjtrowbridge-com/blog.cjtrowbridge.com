[The Magician King](https://amzn.to/2TlyYI4) by Lev Grossman is exactly what I hoped it would be. This is a fast-paced magical adventure book with fully developed characters working together to solve a complex existential problem. This book has all the big magical battles which the first book did not. If you got into this series looking for full-apotheosis mode magical American teenager warriors, this book delivers. You can get the audiobook for free [here](https://amzn.to/2TlyYI4).

Truly an enjoyable read which I will come back to, again and again.
