![Nexus 5](http://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/915570_607675662664086_1242224744_n-465x465.jpg)I am paying just $10 a month for truly unlimited calls, texts, and data; and they mean it. A couple years ago I switched to T-Mobile primarily because they had the Nexus 5 and Verizon didn't. I got lots of perks along the way like [a free $180 router](http://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2015/10/12/how-i-got-a-free-180-asus-rt-ac86u-router/) and no-interest financing for lots of devices like my [Moto 360](http://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2015/01/24/blog-nexus-6-and-moto-360/), [Nexus 5](http://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2014/04/11/choosing-nexus-5-over-galaxy-s5/), and [Nexus 6](http://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2015/01/24/blog-nexus-6-and-moto-360/). Initially, this truly unlimited everything plan was $100/month. But for a while, T-Mobile was doing a promotion where you can add someone to your plan and share the truly unlimited everything for no additional cost, effectively splitting it to just $50/month. ![](http://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/tumblr_nkaowa1zH81rxz2v0o1_1280-465x465.jpg)I jumped on the opportunity, adding my brother to my plan. He got a Moto 360 of his own and a Nexus 6 to go with it, and even with the added cost of financing those devices, he was still paying less than he had been paying before he joined my plan. Next, I convinced my work to switch our company phone plans to T-Mobile, not even knowing this would benefit me. Later I learned of the [Business Family Discount](https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-21923) which allows companies that use T-Mobile to doll out a $40 monthly discount for each line they have. We had about 50 phones signed up with T-Mobile at this point, so there was plenty of room for me on the list. This takes my share of the bill down to just $10 per month and I still get the same truly unlimited everything as when I was paying ten times as much.
