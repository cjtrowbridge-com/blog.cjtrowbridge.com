There needs to be a distributed non-hierarchical way to access the dumps of Wikipedia. Something like GitTorrent or InterplanetaryFileSystem needs to be developed to distribute the contents of Wikipedia, especially the abstracts. This would make it so much easier to do something like [Librarian](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2019/01/12/librarian/). It would be able to mirror everything in the encyclopedia and share it with others, or just search for something specific it needs. This would be a platform upon which to execute a quantum leap for humanity. Just imagine the forks that would evolve and the way a future librarian could compare and contrast opposite perspectives on each issue. Imagine Hegel drooling at the prospect of dialectic progress from rejecting contradictions between competing ideologies in favor of procedurally generated radical syntheses.
