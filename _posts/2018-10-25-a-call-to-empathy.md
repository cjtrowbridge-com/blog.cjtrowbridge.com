The interviews are based on the study "The Experimental Generation of Interpersonal Closeness" by psychologist Arthur Aaron. This study is often talked about as "36 questions to fall in love." The format I would like is to have one or more people discussing the 36 questions and answering them to each other to whatever degree they are comfortable. There will also be discussion about the academic research around likability, intimacy, and attraction. Who wants some love?</iframe>
