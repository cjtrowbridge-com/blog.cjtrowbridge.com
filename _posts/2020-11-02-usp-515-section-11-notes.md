    - Curitiba decided instead to protect historic buildings while adding transit in a way that helped the city improve without fundamentally changing
    - To get around opposition to bans on cars by incumbent institutions including commercial shops in the area, Curitiba completed projects very rapidly, permanently blocking streets overnight in order to prevent petitions and injunctions by the business owners.
