I started this series by watching the first season of the TV show on Netflix. This was a really really great show which I can't recommend highly enough. ![Altered Carbon by Richard K Morgan](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Altered-Carbon-by-Richard-K-Morgan-1-1.jpg)As expected, the book is a much larger and richer story. Like many books adapted to TV shows, many characters have been combined or simplified in the show. The book offers a much clearer and more understandable universe versus the show. I am a huge and a discerning fan of cyberpunk. This is probably the best recent cyberpunk genre literature I've found in a long time. The book is great, the show is great. I can't recommend this highly enough. There are two more books in the series which I can't wait to finish! The author has hinted that he may decide to write additional books. I hope he does! Next up is [Broken Angels](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2018/04/17/broken-angels-by-richard-k-morgan/).
