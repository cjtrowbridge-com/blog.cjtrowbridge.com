- Ratio analysis 
    - Liquidity ratios 
        - Current Ratio: the primary liquidity ratio. 
            - Measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations with its short-term assets
            - Current Ratio = Current assets / current liabilities
        - Quick or Acid test ratio 
            - More stringent liquidity ratio that excludes inventories from current assets to assess a company's ability to cover short-term liabilities without relying on inventory sales
            - Quick or acid test ratio = ( current assets - inventories ) / current liabilities
    - Asset management ratios 
        - Inventory turnover ratio 
            - How efficiently a company manages its inventory by comparing sales to average inventory levels
            - Inventory turnover ratio = sales / inventories
        - Days sales outstanding 
            - The average number of days it takes for a company to collect payment after a sale has been made
            - Days sales outstanding (DSO)
            - = Receivables / Average sales per day
            - = Receivables / (Annual sales / 365)
        - Fixed assets turnover ratio 
            - How efficiently a company is using its fixed assets to generate sales
            - Fixed assets turnover ratio = Sales / Net fixed assets
        - Total assets turnover ratio 
            - How efficiently a company is using its total assets to generate sales
            - Total assets turnover ratio = Sales / Total assets
    - Debt management ratios 
        - Total debt to total capital 
            - Measure of a company's financial leverage, indicating the proportion of debt financing relative to its total capital
            - Total debt / total capital = total debt / (total debt + equity)
        - Times-interest-earned ratio 
            - Measure of a company's ability to meet its interest payments, indicating its financial stability and risk level
            - Times-interest earned (TIE) ratio = EBIT / Interest charges
    - Profitability ratios 
        - Operating margin 
            - Percentage of revenue remaining after deducting operating expenses 
                - efficiency with which the company operates
            - Operating margin = EBIT / Sales
        - Profit margin 
            - Percentage of revenue that a company retains as profit after accounting for expenses 
                - efficiency with which the company converts sales into net income
            - Profit Margin = net income / sales
        - Return on total assets 
            - Measures a company's ability to generate profit from its assets
            - Return on total assets (ROA) = Net income / Total assets
        - Return on common equity 
            - Indicates how well the company is using its capital to generate earnings
            - Return on common equity (ROE) = net income / common equity
        - Return on invested capital 
            - Total return that the company has provided for its investors
            - Return on invested capital (ROIC) = EBIT( 1-T ) / Total invested capital
            - Return on invested capital (ROIC) = EBIT( 1-T ) / ( Debit + equity )
        - Basic earning power (BEP) ratio 
            - Raw earning power of the firm’s assets before the influence of taxes and debt
            - Basic earning power (BEP) ratio = EBIT / total assets
    - Market value ratios 
        - Price/earning ratio 
            - Shows how much investors are willing to pay per share per dollar of reported profits
            - Price/earning ratio (P/E)(PE) = price per share / earnings per share
        - Market/book ratio 
            - Shows how investors value the company
            - Market/book ratio = common equity / shares outstanding
            - = market price per share / book price per share
        - Enterprise value/ ebitda ratio 
            - Looks at the relative market value of all the company’s key financial claims
            - Enterprise value = market value of equity + market value of total debt + market value of other financial claims - cash and equivalents
    - Dupont equation 
        - Return on equity (ROE) = Return on assets (ROA) \* Equity multiplier
        - ROA = Profit margin \* Total assets turnover
        - Equity multiplier = Total assets / Total common equity
        - Profit margin= Net income / sales
    - Like all other ratios, ROE is not the whole picture and maximizing it isn't necessarily the best thing for stakeholders. 
        - Economic value added 
            - A measure of how much management has added to shareholders’ wealth during the year
            - Economic value added (EVA) = EBIT(1-T) - (Total invested capital \* After-tax cost of capital)
    - Using these financial ratios to assess performance 
        - Comparison to industry averages 
            - Compare these ratios to industry averages to rate the firm (ie poor, ok, risky, etc)
        - Benchmarking 
            - Compare each metric in a list alongside competitors to show performance of the firm
        - Trend analysis 
            - Compare the metrics over time to competitors to show whether the numbers are getting better or worse for each
    - Uses and limitations of ratios 
        - Managers use these ratios to analyze and control performance
        - Creditors use these ratios to determine availability of credit and debt
        - Stock analysts use these ratios to determine whether to buy or sell a firm's shares
    - Looking beyond the numbers 
        - Financial analysis metrics are not the whole picture of the company
