<main class="site-main" id="main"><article class="post-13973 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-2021-spring" id="post-13973"><div class="entry-content">The Liberty Bell <a>was forged</a> with the words “Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof.” It was meant to be hung in the Pennsylvania state house (now called Independence Hall). But it cracked when it was first rung. They tried reforging it twice, but every time it was rung, it would crack. Maybe they should have taken this as a sign that a bunch of slavers celebrating liberty was too bullshit for the laws of physics to tolerate. > <iframe data-mce-fragment="1" name="__tt_embed__v57913118530936300" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/6945907062090059013?lang=en-US"></iframe>
