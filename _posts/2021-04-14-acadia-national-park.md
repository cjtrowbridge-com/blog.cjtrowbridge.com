Acadia National Park is a beautiful place. It’s an island off the coast of Maine with a bridge to get there. There are tons of cute little towns and harbors and things to see. I think April is the perfect time to be here. It’s remote but it’s definitely worth the visit! > <iframe data-mce-fragment="1" name="__tt_embed__v71646754672047064" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/6950678602681715974?lang=en-US"></iframe>

 After checking out the park, I headed over to [Geddy’s in Bar Harbor for Lobster Rolls](https://movingcabin.com/static/index.html@p=14020.html). </div><footer class="entry-footer"></footer></article></main>
