Organ Pipe National Monument was pretty cool to see. Lots of weird and interesting plants. I’m glad I stopped by. Here is me with an Organ Pipe Cactus. It’s so named because it looks like the pipes from a church organ.

This is a totally free place to camp for up to two weeks just like Plomosa in Quartzsite. It’s just a few minutes outside the Organ Pipe National Monument so it’s a great spot to stay. ![Jumping Cactus](https://i0.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jumping-Cactus.jpg?resize=780%2C1040&ssl=1)These little dudes are everywhere in the Organ Pipe area. They are called jumping cactus because they like to come apart and jump onto you. Beware! Leaving Gunsight, I called around and found that Loves Travel Stop in Gila Bend takes trash for free which was great. There is also a dump but it’s only open weekday mornings and sadly it’s not free.
