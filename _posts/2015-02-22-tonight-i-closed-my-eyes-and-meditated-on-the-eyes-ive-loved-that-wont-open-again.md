Tonight, I closed my eyes and meditated on the eyes I've loved that wont open again. So many friends live now, only in my heart and memory. So many candles burned bright and did not go quiet into that good night, but raged and raged. In dying, further yet illuminating the already bright inspiration they lent to my days of darkness. They sit now only on clouds around me in my trance, glass candles in my memory, burning bright in that place that never was. Embers lost in the ashes, moments forgotten like tears in rain. Those tears that fall are like the rain from their clouds in another world, pouring out through me. Their raindrops drench the shirt they can never touch, and as long as someone someday cries for me, these candles will never go out, even if these names hold meritt only for me.
