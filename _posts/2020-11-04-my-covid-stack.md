I have for years taken several supplements daily. I recently made some changes based on evidence that these tweaks could support a robust covid response and even reduce the risk of infection.

#### Zyrtec

*[$0.05/day on Amazon](https://amzn.to/35XHb8w)*I have experimented with many options for allergy medicines. This is important as someone with asthma because allergies can trigger asthma and make it worse. At some point, a doctor I spoke to recommended Zyrtec because it has some of the strongest evidence for a broad anti-allergy effect of any of the commonly available over the counter allergy drugs. I tried it and I've never gone back! #### Psyllium Fiber Supplement

*[$0.03/day on Amazon](https://amzn.to/365j8EP)*Most people don't get enough fiber in their diets. This is even worse with stress. Adding a fiber supplement is an easy way to keep your body working through the stress and the coping mechanisms like comfort-foods and binge drinking. ## The Pandemic Additions

#### Vitamin D

[*$0.04/day on Amazon*](https://amzn.to/34ZPOQZ)Vitamin D has been [repeatedly identified](https://www.livescience.com/vitamin-d-covid-19-risk.html) as one of the strongest correlated factors to both a strong covid defense and a strong defense against infection. One study found that homeless people are actually at much lower risk both of infection and of the most severe infection [specifically because they spend so much time in the sun](https://www.uchicagomedicine.org/forefront/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/vitamin-d-deficiency-may-raise-risk-of-getting-covid19) and therefore have a much higher than normal level of Vitamin D. There are two symptom patterns for covid. You can have severe symptoms or you can have mild symptoms. Studies [have shown](https://www.webmd.com/lung/news/20200518/more-vitamin-d-lower-risk-of-severe-covid-19) a strong correlation between the amount of Vitamin D in your system and which pattern you will have. Another study found that [treating patients in the ICU with Vitamin D](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456194/) led to less severe symptoms and better outcomes. Yet [another study](https://www.endocrine.org/news-and-advocacy/news-room/2020/study-finds-over-80-percent-of-covid19-patients-have-vitamin-d-deficiency) found that 80% of those covid patients who had to be hospitalized had Vitamin D deficiencies. #### Zinc

*[$0.20/day on Amazon](https://amzn.to/2TW0MAG)***Caveat:** Zinc [has toxicity](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Zinc-HealthProfessional/) at doses above 150mg/day. So I'll be taking 100mg per day. [There is a great deal of evidence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7365891/) to suggest that Zinc supplements can prevent covid infection, inhibit viral replication in the body, and strengthen the immune response to covid as well as other respiratory disorders. Zinc is a strong general immune booster. These results have been replicated many times. [Here is a list](https://www.uchealth.org/today/zinc-could-help-diminish-extent-of-covid-19/) of the recent studies with summaries of them. #### Vitamin C

[*$0.04/day on Amazon*](https://amzn.to/2JG5TDf)There is [also evidence](https://www.pharmacytimes.com/news/study-vitamins-c-d-may-help-immune-system-fight-covid-19) that Vitamin C can be helpful for covid though studies are ongoing, and there is far less evidence than that for Vitamin D. There is [a great deal of evidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10796569/) that Vitamin C can be used to treat and prevent other coronaviruses such as the common cold. It is a widely held belief that Vitamin C is a general-purpose immune booster, and it does seem that in some cases[ it really is helpful](https://www.yalescientific.org/2015/03/mythbusters-does-vitamin-c-really-help/), and it's certainly an essential nutrient which people must be sure to get. Bottom line with Vitamin C as well as with Zinc, there is potentially a huge benefit and really no downside.
