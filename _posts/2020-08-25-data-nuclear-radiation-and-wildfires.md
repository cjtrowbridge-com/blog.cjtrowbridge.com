I am conducting a long-term experiment of the environmental factors associated with the wildefires. One factor I am looking at is the ambient nuclear radiation levels.

## Hypothesis

I believe that when the fires start, we will see a significant increase in radionuclide count per minute, because of [naturally occurring radioactive materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturally_occurring_radioactive_material) being released into the air. ## Methodology

As part of an ongoing experiment, I am using [two sensor arrays (inside and outside)](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/06/07/fire-season-sensor-array/) to measure several environmental factors in the context of the wildfires, including nuclear radiation. The data is being logged every minute as a count of how many radionuclides the sensor detected each minute. ## Results

![Ambient Radionuclides and Wildfires](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ambient-Radionuclides-and-Wildfires-1-1.png)As you can see from this initial data, there is a significant increase in ambient radioactivity associated with the wild fires. In fact ambient radiation levels are now up to 32% higher than before the wildfires began. ![Data](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Data-1-1.png)
