- Principles are rules or beliefs that govern our actions
- Values are things you think are important or not important which inform behavior
- Obscure, solidify, reify the power dynamic
- Policies are based on values 
    - Policies reflect who has more power
- Professor wants us to think about policies and laws and zoning codes that get embedded on the books as values. 
    - Because she wants us to understand that everything that happens is the result of power dynamics.
- Technology is the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes, especially in industry.

This session will focus on the principles and values that inform student's analysis of urban conditions and on what students hope to see in cities of the future. The following questions will guide our discussion â€“ in 8 breakout rooms, one group for each question:

1. What principles and values can guide us as we examine and envision alternative models and scenarios for the future of cities?
2. How can the principles developed by the Black Lives Matter activists inform our principles?
3. To what extent can social and economic change be planned?
4. Who should be responsible for determining the direction of change in cities?
5. Where and when should people be proactive in pushing for change?
6. How can cities and metropolitan regions be reorganized to produce urban futures that are more sustainable, equitable, and livable?
7. What are the impacts of increasing inequality in the United States?
8. When we focus on alternative urban futures, how important is it to focus on large scale dynamics related to the structure of society and the economy?
