[One hundred PM2.5 (N95 quality) filter inserts costs just twelve dollars.](https://amzn.to/3aaDwGt)For a face mask to be rated N95 means it must filter particulate matter down to 2.5 microns (PM2.5). **PM2.5 covers both viruses and smoke particles.**The problem today is that medical professionals need the N95 masks and hoarding them will get people killed. If you're staying at home, there are [great alternatives](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/05/23/preparing-for-the-worst-fire-season-ever/) which are even better for homes than N95 masks and cost just a few dollars. As fire season gets started, this is more important than ever. For those who want face masks for going out, there is another alternative to hoarding needed medical supplies.
