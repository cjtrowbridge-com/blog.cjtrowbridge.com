It took me a few tries to really dive into this book, but once I did, it was an instant favorite. As far as sci-fi goes, it's fairly light. There is not a lot of technical detail; it's more about the abstract side of an adventure undertaken by a group of very independent people in a future dystopia. These people find themselves forced to work together and eventually form strong friendships on their way to conquering a shared enemy. It's a great story which I will certainly read many times over in the future. I look forward to the movie coming out next year and I hope they don't pretty it up, because this story is full of dirty, ugly realness. And that's its biggest strength in my opinion. I rate is a must-read for any sci-fi or cyberpunk fan or for anyone who is a fan of the 1980s :\] ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a4/Ready_Player_One_cover.jpg)
