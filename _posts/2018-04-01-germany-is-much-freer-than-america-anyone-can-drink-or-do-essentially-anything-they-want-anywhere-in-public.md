title: 'Germany is much freer than America. Anyone can drink or do essentially anything they want, anywhere in public. And they do. I saw people drinking and having sex everywhere from trains to parks and sidewalks. America thinks it has freedom, but really it has a fascistic culture of neurotic religious superstitions which no one is allowed to disagree with. America has a lot to learn from more developed and civilized countries.'
