        - Dynamics of power: where, how, who makes decision related to who is protected from harm

            - Legacy of slavery is a factor in determining land use policies
            - City of San Francisco owns lots of land around the state which are used to deliver services and utilities to the city 
                - This makes those lands vassals which serve the needs of San Francisco, suffering harms from dumping and other problems for the benefit of people living in San Francisco

    - The 580 freight ban 
        - Rich white people in the Oakland hills ban freight traffic through their neighborhoods in order to protect themselves from harm
        - Harm is shifted to poor black neighborhoods

#### Other Notes

- WW2 and wealth redistribution 
    - War veterans were supposed to get many benefits 
        - Mortgages including free down payment
        - Education
        - Access to veteran healthcare
        - Hiring incentives for employers
        - This mostly only for white people and only for men
        - Black people could get debt, where white people got free money for these things.
    - This gave trillions of dollars to white people and funded the creation of the suburbs
- Talked about red lining and segregation 
    - Green book
    - Hegemonic food culture
- Small group discussion about "<span class="">Which came first, people or pollution</span>" 
    - It's complicated
    - Siting versus post-siting effects for hazardous waste facilities and why they are sited in certain places
    - I live in West Oakland because it's cheap 
        - It's cheap because it's polluted. 
            - It became polluted because it was mostly black.
    - In this case, the hazardous waste sites were placed in certain kinds of marginalized neighborhoods. The people came before the pollution.
    - LULU: Locally unwanted land uses 
        - Zoning and permitting 
            - Institutional discrimination can decide where hazardous things are permitted.
        - land values are more affordable
        - political process - access to information, representation
        - commingled factors - transportation, workers, air quality, utilities, space -- large buildings
    - people came second: demographic changes after siting have led to increasing concentration of minorities and the poor around these sites 
        - employment opportunities
        - cost of housing less expensive
        - social networks
        - culture
        - law, politics, housing covenants, laws, redlining
