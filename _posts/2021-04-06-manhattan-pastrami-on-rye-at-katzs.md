 <article class="post-13977 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-2021-spring" id="post-13977"><div class="entry-content">I’ve been scouring all the online food guides as I traverse the nation, looking for gems. This is one to remember. A LOT of people have responded to my post about this sandwich with stories of their own pilgrimages to Katz’s deli in New York City. The process of actually buying the sandwich was very complex and confusing, made even more challenging by the intricate covid restrictions in place. This did make me feel safer about eating at a deli under covid, so there’s that. I bought the Pastrami on Rye and an IPA, then headed to Central Park to eat it. I looked it up online and found that drinking beer in Central Park is illegal, but they had given me a cup to go with a straw so I couldn’t really save it for later. I just downed it quickly before walking into the park. The sandwich itself came with spicy mustard and pickles on the side. The meat was very flavorful and it had a nice texture. It was halfway through enjoying the sandwich that I noticed the price I had paid for it was $42. LMAO. So I gave the other half to a homeless person to reconcile myself with the ridiculous price I had paid for the sandwich. Overall it was very delicious, but I would absolutely never pay that much for a sandwich on purpose. I need to start checking the prices as this keeps happening with me and sandwiches on this trip. > <iframe data-mce-fragment="1" name="__tt_embed__v72550007961063300" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed/v2/6948226376004619526?lang=en-US"></iframe>
