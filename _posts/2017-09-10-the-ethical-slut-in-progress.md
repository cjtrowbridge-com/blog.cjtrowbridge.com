At burning man last year, I attended a wedding. There is some sweet 360 footage in a [recent post](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2016/09/17/burning-man-2016-360-videos/) about burning man. The bride and groom gave unusual vows, promising to respect and never try to change one-another rather than the traditional vow of forsaking all others. And there were other differences from the traditional model. I have long been consciously aware that monogamy is an unnatural cultural construct, and an artifact of the influence of bronze-age Abrahamic religion on modern culture. But as someone who has only ever practiced monogamy as a default, I was fascinated and talked at some length with each of the newlyweds over the course of the week. They and many others recommended I read this book to get a better understanding of what non-monogamy is and how it works, and the deeper fulfillment and satisfaction it can offer as a more natural and healthy alternative to monogamy. I prefer audiobooks, and this one was very easy to find online, and read by the authors themselves. It is a very intense read, and packed with information and concepts that need some reflecting and unpacking. It took me over a year to finish reading. I set it down to reflect and experiment at least a dozen times, and each time I started over at the beginning. This is my own unusual method and the only way I feel like I can really absorb all the content from something as intense and broad-reaching as this. It doesn't necessarily advocate for polyamory. It is more an exploration of what it means to be monogamous or to be polyamorous, and how to make rational choices about the kind of person you want to be, and then how to be that person well. I decided to change almost every part of myself after reading this book. I recommend also checking out [this interview](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2017/05/27/podcast-tim-ferriss-interviews-esther-perel-on-maintaining-desire-and-rethinking-infidelity/) which I found closely related to this topic and helped me to parse much of the content. ![The Ethical Slut](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/51rg57YwZEL-1-1.jpg)
