These two together is automatically magic, and the fact that they are drunk in a rural Japanese bathhouse should hardly surprise anyone who follows them. ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tim-ferriss-1-1.png)Kevin Rose turns 40 the day before the episode was recorded, which seems shocking because I remember [seeing him on BusinessWeek](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kevin-Rose-BusinessWeek-1-1.jpg) when I was selling websites at 18 years old and aspiring to do the things he was doing. They talk about a lot of different topics from building apps to Japanese culture and lots of other interesting topics. This line stuck with me, "\[Apps don't\] have to be everything on day one... \[Take your\] list of 15 features that you would like to see in the next two years, narrow it down to 3 to 5 that you must have for version 1.0 and go launch with that." -Kevin Rose [Check it out!](http://tim.blog/2017/02/26/the-random-show-drinking-urine-exploring-japan-and-figuring-out-life/)\[embed\]http://traffic.libsyn.com/timferriss/The\_Tim\_Ferriss\_Show\_-\_The\_Random\_Show\_Japan.mp3\[/embed\]
