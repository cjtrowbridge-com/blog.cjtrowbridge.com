Normally, Alphabet would be a slow-mover, though a safe bet. But unique circumstances in the next few months which make this a good buy now for faster growth. Nasdaq reports that 34/35 analysts are currently bullish on Alphabet. Research shows that Alphabet now has more staff devoted to developing their VR division than Facebook and HTC combined, even with Facebook's expensive acquisition of Oculus. Alphabet's VR division is also growing much more quickly than the competition. For these reasons, analysts accurately predicted a big announcement from Google at I/O about a consolidated VR platform. Google also announced several other compelling products which affirm analysts average price target of $914. The stock is currently trading at $709, a 28% average predicted increase. I will bet +10/-5%
