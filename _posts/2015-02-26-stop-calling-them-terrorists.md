Stop calling them terrorists. Accuse them of a specific crime. They are criminals, not fairytale monsters. A real conversation needs clarity of language. The only way we could get where we are today is by ignoring the details and reality of what has happened and focusing on emotional reactions to scary, abstract ideas like terror. Use phrases like "Self proclaimed serial killer" instead of words like "Jihadi." Xenophobia does nothing but entrench you inside this cult that is Fear. Arrest criminals instead spending a decade and trillions of dollars occupying random geographical areas which may or may not have contained those criminals at some point.
