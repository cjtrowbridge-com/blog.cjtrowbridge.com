#### **<span class="">Videos </span>

- [<span class="">The Green New Deal: Putting the climate at the heart of global policy </span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bovsn-5HW6k)<span class="">- Jeremy Rifkin </span><span class="">(9 minutes)</span>
    - Animal and insect populations under threat around the world
    - Sea levels rising
    - Planet getting hotter because of fossil fuels
    - It's not too late to change course
    - GND: Fossil fuel economy will collapse by 2028 
        - GND is an aspirational document
        - Patterned after the new deal of the 1930s. 
            - Roosevelt initiated massive programs to get people back to work
        - GND helps us move quickly out of a fossil fuel economy in order to avoid mass extinctions 
            - We are on course to lose half the species on earth within the century.
    - Renewable solar energy is now cheaper than the other energy sources 
        - This means a widespread economic collapse will happen in the energy sector because the capital invested in obsolete polluting energy sources is going to move to sustainable alternatives like solar
    - Every region and community needs to locally implement GND principles in order to move into the new era of sustainable energy production and consumption
    - Long-term equity (pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, etc.) moving out of bad bets on fossil fuels is a hugely powerful force for change.
    - Small sustainable pilot projects need to expand to huge widespread projects 
        - This will allow long-term equity bets to move into these projects in a big way.
- [<span class="">Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Breaks Down What the Green New Deal Really Is</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xtf9QE-lME) (5 minutes)

    - Homelessness
    - Free education for all

#### Class Discussion

- Played video of spoken word poem 
    - If the lifespan of the earth is a day then humans have existed for three seconds and in that time basically wrecked everything, destroyed the environment, and initiated an extermination of the population including ourselves.
- GND is the first attempt to meet the scale of the challenges of the climate crisis 
    - Justice, equity, jobs, etc
    - Advocates for large government investments in programs and projects to resolve the crisis
- The long-term actuarial perspective of institutional capital from sources like pension funds can be a powerful force for change through green investments in renewable energy, sustainability, and resilience in the developing world.
