[![The Last Command by Timothy Zahn](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/The-Last-Command-by-Timothy-Zahn-1-1.jpg)The Last Command](https://amzn.to/2Z8JYIT) was a really wild book. The further along it went, the more clear it became that this series is not canon. ðŸ¤£ Leah's children have different names, some major characters die, some relationships change in different ways than they should for the rebels series. Keeping all that in mind, it's a great story. I definitely recommend it. ## Spoilers

Ok so I was really frustrated that the story shifted focus towards C'baoth. I found him to be a boring character who wasn't interesting to read about and explore. I wanted to see Thrawn in action, and you never really do. What was his grand plan? And then at the end, seeing him die in such a boring way, it was so frustrating.
