Yesterday, I was at the pharmacy picking up my PrEP, and there was a houseless woman who had been mugged. She had just come from her doctor getting replacements for her seizure medicine for this month; she couldn't stop shaking. The people at the pharmacy told her that her insurance wouldn't cover her meds since she had already filled her prescription this month. A frantic look came over her because the medicine was very expensive and without it she would start having seizures. She explained to no avail that whatever money she had was stolen along with her medicine. Helping was the easiest choice I've made in a long time.
