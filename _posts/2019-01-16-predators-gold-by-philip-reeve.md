[Predator's Gold](https://amzn.to/2Me0ujM) was an amazing sequel to [Mortal Engines](https://admin.blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2019/01/13/mortal-engines-by-philip-reeve/).I hope they continue the film franchise, because this book gets into even more interesting sociological perspectives on potential dystopian futures. We see a deeper dive into issues of classism and nepotism within social darwinism, and we also touch on the reality that people will always cheat systems; that social darwinism becomes a competition to see who can cheat, not who has the most merit. The idea of natural meritocratic orders are thoroughly and effectively criticised. [![Predator's Gold](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Predators-Gold-1-1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2Me0ujM)I would recommend this book to anyone who likes science fiction, or anyone interested in sociology and futurism. This is a proud and worthy addition to the ideological lexicon of the cyberpunk genre!
