Philly Cheesesteak is the obvious choice in Philly. I found this great place called Johnâ€™s Roast Pork on a food blog. I drove several hours to get there, and very nearly missed out. I got one of the last sandwiches of the day! It had very little cheese. It was mostly this great moist and flavorful steak with just a little bit of sharp provolone, and then baked to bring out the sesame flavor in the bread. So good! I would absolutely go back for another one.
