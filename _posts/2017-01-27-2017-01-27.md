#### This/Each Week

- Stay up on [Medium](https://medium.com/) and contribute regularly 
    - I feel like the quality of medium has gone down. I find myself less interested and finding less content I enjoy. I will remove this goal.
- Advance on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains)
    - I have not made time for this. I will create an event this week to try to do so.
- Read [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
    - I read this every day
- Read [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses)
    - I have stayed up on this and even gone to a live event of his since the last time I wrote about this.
- Earn a quarter of my money with Ridesharing 
    - I am deprecating this goal as I no longer believe in this.
- Earn a quarter of my money freelancing 
    - I still need to get this going. I will create an event this week to make some progress.
- Eat Less, Eat Better, Drink More Water 
    - I would say I have accomplished this.

    - I have this in for later this week. It has been a few weeks. I need to do better here.

    - I have put it off because of being in limbo at work. I am still in limbo, but enough other things have happened for this to seem worth doing.
- Blog post about each major area of focus 
    - Investment 
        - My stock portfolio currently constitutes the entirety of my investments. It is at +27% for the last month, having recovered all of the losses I suffered during the election.
    - Book Reviews 
        - I have not made time for reading, and I intend to do so this week, now that I am settling into my new schedule and the anxiety of the school semester starting has passed.
    - Machine Learning 
        - I have made some interesting contacts and expanded my thoughts on how I will go about getting into this.
