They were not dualists any more than they were monotheists. They were in fact monolaterists who believed in all gods and chose to worship only their own; Yahweh. This is actually still evidenced in the modern bible when references are made to other gods like Baal. It wasn't until the second council of Nicea and the debate around icons that over forty neighboring gods of the hebrews were converted into the newly created devil, and that was in the fifth century, thousands of years after the writing of the verse you're quoting. Many christians and jews and mormons and other religions reject your monotheistic interpretation. This idea is only in vogue in a small group in modern America.</span></div></div><div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="3nt2r" data-offset-key="8ajf0-0-0"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="8ajf0-0-0"><span data-offset-key="8ajf0-0-0"> </span></div></div><div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="3nt2r" data-offset-key="1l8s6-0-0"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="1l8s6-0-0"><span data-offset-key="1l8s6-0-0">Fourth the whole point of the deuteronomists was that they took the consort of Yahweh out of the text and the canon. God had a wife before that, Asherah. But the way of worshipping her was to fuck prostitutes at her temples, and that didn't fit with the ultra-conservative vision of the deuteronomists, so they deleted her.</span></div></div><div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="3nt2r" data-offset-key="86det-0-0"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="86det-0-0"><span data-offset-key="86det-0-0"> </span></div></div><div class="" data-block="true" data-editor="3nt2r" data-offset-key="43kig-0-0"><div class="_1mf _1mj" data-offset-key="43kig-0-0"><span data-offset-key="43kig-0-0">So no, that is not at all what that verse means, even within Christian mythology. You should do some more learning before you try to teach people about a religion you don't seem to know anything about."</span></div></div>
