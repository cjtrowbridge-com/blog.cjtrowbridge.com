research adding bittorrent protocol to progressive offline bootstrap service workers It should not be this hard to use bittorrent as a protocol in browsers and especially in html5 apps. It should be just as easy to bootstrap service workers versus btsync. There is just no reason for servers to exist. This is low-key terrifying because I know it will be misused but also it will radically revolutionize apps and it will absolutely happen eventually so why not lead the charge and try to instill the best possible uses into the people doing the work?
