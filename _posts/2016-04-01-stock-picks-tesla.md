Tesla is announcing their Model 3 today. I believe the stock will see a dramatic bump because this car is going to change the world. It is affordable, excellent and a real alternative to gasoline cars. Elon Musk believes in what he is doing, and he will not stop until it is done. This is a leader you can believe in and trust to accomplish his goals. This car is going to be an incredible product. And with pre-orders, this is going to be a ton of new cash for Tesla overnight. Some people on WSB are betting on +12% but I'm setting a goal of +5% to be safe. **Update: 4/4**My bet paid off, and i finished up 5%!
