This book is REALLY great. Having just finished the first Thrawn trilogy and now the Hand Duology, this book is the best, the pinnacle of the story so far. [![Vision of the Future by Timothy Zahn](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Vision-of-the-Future-by-Timothy-Zahn-1-1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/3gGbiWr)I really liked the focus on many interesting characters and the way the stories all tied together. \[Spoilers\] It seems safe to say at this point that Thrawn is actually dead. Next I'll read the second Thrawn trilogy and learn his origin story!
