This post is not about the controversial side of this photo. <small>Briefly, this is one of the American President's children sitting in his place at the 2017 G20 summit in Berlin, as though she had some legitimate role in elected government. In place of this absentee president, some random relative of his is sitting in his seat and representing America on the world stage. Many people rightly cried nepotism and decried the obvious dynastic implications of a president sending a random relative to sit in his place at a meeting of world leaders.</small>\[caption id="attachment\_8772" align="aligncenter" width="680"\]![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/g20-1-1.jpg) Ivanka Trump at the 2017 G20 Summit\[/caption\]

## Look Closer

Every table for every world leader has the same four beverages sitting on it, along with an empty glass. - Orange Juice
- Apple Juice
- Sparkling Water
- Flat Water

Even in this polarized and divided group of people who represent disparate values and priorities; there is consensus on some fundamental detail, however trivial. It puts it into perspective that the issues we disagree about today are by no means the whole picture. The vast majority of the developed world has a clear consensus on at least some degree of socialism. We largely agree on free-trade capitalism as a driver of globalism. We agree on some level of democracy, whether direct or indirect, and we agree on orange and apple juice.
