I read this book as part of a LGBT studies class at Sierra College for my degree in Social Justice. It's a great read and eponymously covers the history of an important marginalized group in America; transgender people. **As always, I am happy to share the audiobook with any friends who want a copy.**[![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Transgender-History-by-Susan-Stryker-1-1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2BJozLc)This book is an excellent introduction to many of the concepts and terms related to the history of transgender issues in America. There is a big focus on intersectionality and the related history of the women's movements and the LGBT movement. One thing I especially liked is the way she compares gender and sexual orientation to language. Humans are definitely wired to have language, but we are not wired with a particular language. Likewise, we are wired for sex, orientation, and gender, but not for a specific sex, orientation, or gender.
