<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">#### Major overhaul

Removed lots of things from this list and from my life. Divided everything on here into three block-level sections: - Current Goals
- Long-Term Goals
- Potential Goals

I have made tremendous progress since my last update. - I am no longer working at Tech 2U
- I have a strong safety net in place
- I am well on my way to completing my academic and broader goals

Minimizing this list and clarifying the roadmap are the biggest hurdles I overcome with this update. Looking forward to the next one! </div><div class="col-xs-12 col-md-3">#### Academics

- **Khan Academy:** I have not made enough progress here. I will need to accomplish a lot more before next semester.
- **[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/featured/top_specializations_locale_en_os_web):** this has taken a back burner, but it is still a large longer-term goal. 
    - [\*Stanford Machine Learning with Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
    - [\*University of Michigan Applied Data Science with Python](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python)
    - [\*Princeton Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency)
    - [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming)
    - [MATLAB](https://www.coursera.org/learn/matlab)
- **Xfer =&gt; PSU/SDSU:** still on track here 
    - I will transfer to PSU or SDSU to complete my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
- **Xfer =&gt; \_\_\_**
    - I will get a Masters in Business Administration.

- Programming 
    1. Java: i have learned java and am taking further courses. removing.
    2. NodeJS: i have not made progress here, but it is still a longer-term goal
    3. React: facebook's patent actions have made this goal irrelevant. removing.

    5. C#: this is still a longer-term goal
    6. Angular: removing.
    7. C++: taking a class on this. removing.
- Learn new skills: all of these have taken a back burner. maybe i should create a back-burner section to separate non-urgent goals.
