A distributed app called Librarian. It has access to all of wikipedia, brittanica, and other libraries via gittorrent or something like that so that nodes can share content and update it together. A user query can answer questions about entries. For example, "What is x," gives the abstract for x. Then research questions like cross-referencing and other common research use cases can be asked. Like an encyclopedia assistant.
