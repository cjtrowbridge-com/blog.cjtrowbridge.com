In my capacity as regional co-chair of Burners Without Borders, I once asked some of my peers if there is a manual somewhere for how to respond to disasters. That's what we do. We respond to disasters and provide things like shelter and critical infrastructure. Unfortunately there is currently no repository of tools and strategies for responding to disasters. Since this is so closely related to my other projects [NomadPedia](https://nomadpedia.org) and [Resource-Sovereignty](https://resource-sovereignty.net), I decided to try to take on building a blog about what we've done in the past and what has worked well. This will hopefully become a tool for those who are responding to these kinds of disasters in the future, and a living document that we can continue to develop and update as we continue to work on providing shelter and infrastructure to disaster areas around the world.
