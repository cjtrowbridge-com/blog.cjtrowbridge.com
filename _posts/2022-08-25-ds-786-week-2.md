        - Forecast: a statement about the future
            - To be of value, the forecast is about a future event that we don't have complete certainty for?
            - Given what we know now, how much do we expect to sell next month?
        - Forecast Time Horizons
            - Short-range: immediate future to three months
            - Medium-range: several months to a year
            - Long-range: more than one year
        - Common Aspects of Forecasts
            - Assumes causal system: path =&gt; future
                - Do observations of past behavior have relevance in predicting future behavior?
            - Forecasts are never perfect (we just need them to be good enough)
            - Forecasts are more accurate for groups vs individuals
                - (ie sales of the category greek yogurt not just single-serving non-fat strawberry)
            - Forecast accuracy decreases with time
                - Predicting next week's sales has less uncertainty than predicting sales 50 weeks out.
        - Steps in the forecasting process
            - Step 1 Determine the purpose of the forecast
            - Step 2 Establish time horizon
            - Step 3 Select forecasting technique
            - Step 4 Gather and analyze data in detail
                - State any assumptions
                - Validate data: may need to cleanse of filter for past events
            - Step 5 Calculate forecast
            - Step 6 Analyze/monitor the forecast - 
                - Measure accuracy, are results acceptable?
                    - No: Return to step 3
                    - Yes: Publish forecast
        - Types of forecasts
            - Judgmental
                - Use subjective inputs
                    - Consumer surveys, opinions of managers and staff: ie Delphi method
            - Time Series
                - Use historical data and assuming the future will be similar to the past
            - Associative forecasts
                - Use explanatory variables other than time to predict the future.
        - Time series foreacasting
            - Plot your data and look for patterns
            - Trend: Long-term movement in data
                - Linear: steady increase or decrease over time
                - Nonlinear: demand may be exponential, may both increase and decrease over product life cycle
            - Seasonality: short-term regular variations in data
                - What season does walgreens sell the most allergy meds
                - Not just limited to fall/winter/spring/summer variations
                    - Which days are busiest for fancy restaurants?
                    - Daily cycle at starbucks: when do they sell the most coffee drinks?
            - Irregular variations: caused by unexpected events
                - Infrequent spikes or troughs like toilet paper in 2020
            - Random variations: caused by change
    - [Learn how to do a Naive Forecast (4:33)](https://youtu.be/Uha-JEMXZG0)
        - Naive forecasts
            - Stable time-series data
                - eg. sold 50 tires last week, so expect to sell 50 this week
            - Seasonal variations
                - sold 50k heart shaped candy boxes last February so expect to sell 50k this February.
            - Data with trends
                - sold 50 lattes yesterday but 45 the day before so expect to sell 55 today!
        - Naive forecasting: pros and cons
            - Pros
                - You only need one data point
                - Can start soon
                - It's easy
                - Easy to explain simply
            - Cons
                - Not very accurate
            - Naive forecasts are useful as a benchmark or lower bound for accuracy
    - [Working with the Moving Average (4:54)](https://youtu.be/A2u1EPncLJg)
        - Simple moving average
            - The average of N most recent observations
            - The larger the N, the smoother the forecast, but the greater the lag (ability to respond to "real" changes)
    - [How to Work with Weighted Moving Averages and Exponential Smoothing (6:38)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmxlus_E_l8)
        - Weighted moving average
            - Premise: the most recent observations might have the best predictive value. Yet for simple moving averages, older data points have same importance as most recent
            - Solution: Assign weights to give more importance to more recent observations. (Weights must be between 0 and 1 and all weights must sum to 1 or you get bias)
            - Advantages: avoids over-smoothing and lag time is decreased
            - Weights are often found through trial and error, no one set of weights work best for all situations.
        - Exponential smoothing
            - Exponential smoothing is a type of weighted moving average that considers all time periods that we have data for, but gives them exponentially less weight the further back in time they fall
- [Measuring Forecast Accuracy for Stable Time Series Data (5:23)](https://youtu.be/fmSzST1ivgA)
    - How to select a forecast
        - for data without trends or seasonality, we could use
            - a simple naive forecast
            - a moving average
            - a weighted moving average
            - an exponential smoother
        - We will get different answers with each technique
            - How do we pick the one most likely to be close to what will happen
        - We calculate past forecast accuracy
    - Measuring forecast accuracy
        - Many different measures exist, such as MSE (mean squared error) and MAPE but in this class we will only calculate mean absolute deviation (MAD)
        - First define an error as the difference between the actual value and predicted value for that time period
        - The take the absolute value of this error
        - Sum these absolute values and take the average
