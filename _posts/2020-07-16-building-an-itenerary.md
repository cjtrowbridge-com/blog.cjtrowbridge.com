Public health officials across the country are arguing that [camping is the safest thing to be doing during covid](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/12/26/public-health-officials-say-that-camping-is-one-of-the-safest-things-to-do-during-covid/). I built a [moving cabin](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/09/24/building-a-travel-trailer/) in order to do more camping and spend time away from other people. Since everything is work-from-home, including school, there is really no reason to be anywhere in particular. I decided not to waste this opportunity, and to hit the road and safely see the country while the apocalypse unfolds. What else am I going to do this year? With satellite internet and cell phone service, I can work from home anywhere on the continent just as easily as being here at home bored out of my mind and staring at a screen all day every day.

## National Parks

[Randy Olson](http://www.randalolson.com/2016/07/30/the-optimal-u-s-national-parks-centennial-road-trip/) developed and published the following route for visiting all the national parks (In the 48 states) as efficiently as possible; I will be basing my trip on this route, with detours for other interesting destinations I want to visit. Because I am going to be visiting so many national parks, it makes sense to get a [park pass](https://store.usgs.gov/pass) rather than paying separate daily fees at all the parks. ## Food

About ten years ago, I drove across the country in order ot move my grandparents to California. Everywhere we stopped was basically truck stops and hotels. The food options were boring so I always ordered the same thing, a club sandwich. This was funny and meta but in retrospect kind of boring. This time, I am interested in sampling the local flavor. Here are the guides I will be looking at: - [Buzzfeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/farrahpenn/here-are-the-meals-that-best-represents-each-state?utm_source=dynamic&utm_campaign=bffbbuzzfeedquiz&ref=bffbbuzzfeedquiz&fbclid=IwAR2naJ_jXQ2r7VBQvW0c-jWL7lgKm9YQJJMkCljXgCa-mZqgj1lQg38htL4)

## Mostly Free

It may come as a surprise but it’s actually very easy to camp for free and there are lots of great [free places to camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joecuvHwf7Q). BLM/USDA sites are usually free, and there are millions of acres where dispersed camping is free. I recently did a completely free week-long trip to the Mammoth Lakes area in California. On this much longer trip, I’ll also be staying mostly at free sites. ## Tentative Itinerary

Here is my full working-list of places and things I want to visit and see. Camping has been arbitrarily banned in California for the next few months despite being the safest thing to do right now [according to public health departments across the country](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2020/12/26/public-health-officials-say-that-camping-is-one-of-the-safest-things-to-do-during-covid/), therefore I will be skipping the California parks until the end of the trip. - January 1 – February 22
