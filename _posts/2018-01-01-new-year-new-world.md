When was the last time you saw a movie where the future didn't suck? In fact, when was the last time you heard any kind of story or idea about a future which is better than today? This is a bad habit for civilization, and one for which I intend to be part of the solution. My new years resolution is to stop sharing or adding my voice to ideas which depict tomorrow or the future pessimistically. I think that any valid criticism or caution about the future can still be made, without needing to live in this cult of pessimistic defeatism our culture has created. Additionally, I will soapbox about this as often as possible to help share the idea of future-optimism and a conviction for furthering it, rather than sharing its opposite.
