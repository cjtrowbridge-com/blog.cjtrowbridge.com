![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/THE-EDGE-OF-HUMANITY-A-Conversation-with-Yuval-Noah-Harari-1-1.png)This was one of the best interviews I've ever heard. They cover the history and future of humanity, and the current transition between two different kinds of cultural conflict. In the past, humans fought oppressive tyrants who exploited them.

What does a realistic future look like and how do we get there?
