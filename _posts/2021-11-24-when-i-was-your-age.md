###### This post is part of a guest series called [Discursive Construction](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2021/11/24/discursive-construction-ai-generated-essays-and-analysis/), and was written by an advanced artificial intelligence. The bold at the beginning is the prompt, and the rest was written by the AI. If you'd like to support this project, please [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/cjtrowbridge).

 **When an old person argues, "When I was your age, I had a house, a wife, a career, and two kids." And a young person responds, 'daddy doesn't know the irreducible ontological incompleteness of the reality." What the young person means is** that if they want to be happy, they must shift their paradigms, and shift the paradigms of their whole intelligible world, and start over again. The question is what the young person will choose to do. If they choose to start over, they will be happy. If they choose to stay with what used to work, they will not have a choice about that, because they will feel unhappy whether or not they admit it to themselves.
