There have been several high-profile cases in the news this week about people choking people. I wanted to bring it up and talk about some important facts. Consent must be talked about before-hand. Non-consensual choking, even during consensual sex, is strangulation. It is felony assault and it is attempted homicide; with a mandatory prison sentence. Beyond the legal definitions, it is also the number one indicator that a person will go on to kill a partner in the future, and since it is a power-and-control-dynamic, it is also one of the highest indicators that abuse and violence will escalate in the future between the two partners. It is not ok to choke another person, even during consensual sex, without talking about it beforehand and getting an explicit and enthusiastic yes to that specific act. Furthermore, if a person wants to do that to you, it is extremely likely that it will lead to more violence and potentially homicide in the future. <https://www.strangulationtraininginstitute.com/about-us/>[ http://time.com/5269444/eric-schneiderman-sponsored-strangulation-law/](http://time.com/5269444/eric-schneiderman-sponsored-strangulation-law/)<https://www.vox.com/identities/2018/5/10/17340008/anthony-wall-police-waffle-house-video>
