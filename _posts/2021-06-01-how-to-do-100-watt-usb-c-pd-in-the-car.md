I have personally found a good solution to this problem. Modern laptops [like mine](https://amzn.to/3uHKoDy) require a much higher power input than what you can get out of a normal USB car charger. In the past, I really like this 39-watt QC-3 charger which is what I use in the car for charging my phone. Now this would eventually charge your PD-100 (Power Delivery at 100 watts) laptop but it will take much longer, and it's not enough power to keep it running. So how to get PD-100 (100 watts) for your USB-charging laptop in the car? There are some cheap and super sketchy "PD" products on the market [like this one](https://amzn.to/3vJRYPk). So there are a lot of red flags here. First of all it says it's both QC 3 and PD-60. That doesn't make any sense, especially considering it's $15. Buying this kind of sketchy product is basically asking to get your laptop fried. 100w PD is too new to have reliable commodity accessories like this. PD chargers are expensive because its really easy to design them poorly and then they fry your computer. Don't go cheap on your Power Delivery charger or you'll regret it. Just use an inverter with a 120v charger. This is the charger that I use. I love it, it works great. It's tiny and easy to store, and it can also charge a second device at the same time. ![USB C Charger for MacBook Pro Air, RAVPower 90W 2-Port Wall Charger PD 3.0 GaN Type C Fast Charging Adapter](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/USB-C-Charger-for-MacBook-Pro-Air-RAVPower-90W-2-Port-Wall-Charger-PD-3.0-GaN-Type-C-Fast-Charging-Adapter.jpg)Then just plug that into a 120v inverter. I like this one because it's affordable and reputable and super highly rated. It also has a couple of extra USB-A plugs that you can use to charge other things at the same time.

That way your laptop will be safe and you can easily run it in the car. Just make sure to get something reputable with good reviews from a trusted brand like this one. I really like that Gallium Nitride charger I linked above because it's tiny and easy to store and I can just leave it with the inverter in the glove box. Happy laptopping!
