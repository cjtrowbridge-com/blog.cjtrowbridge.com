[Letter To A Christian Nation](https://amzn.to/2LCG8Cv) is a very direct critique of Christianity from the perspective of rational Americans. He attacks head on the basis of Christianity and its many arguments, as well as the argument that it is a good thing for anyone. [![Letter To A Christian Nation by Sam Harris](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Letter_to_a_Christian_Nation-1-1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2LCG8Cv)There are many very excellent arguments in this book which I am already using and will continue to use. This is a book that any atheist or humanist should read.
