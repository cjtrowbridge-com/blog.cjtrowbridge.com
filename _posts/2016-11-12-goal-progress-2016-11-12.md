- Advance on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/mission/algebra-basics)
    - This has proven difficult to find time for, but I have blocked off the bulk of my free time this week to devote to making some real progress here. Time is getting short!
- Stay up on [Medium](https://medium.com/)
    - I have really done a lot here. This has become my go-to instead of reddit and facebook. I find myself marking a lot of things to come back and re-read. Medium has become a huge part of my regular learning and growing.
- Advance on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains)
    - I haven't made time for this. I have been too busy lately and I probaly will be for some time, but it is still something important that will become more important once I complete my Khan Academy work.
- Read [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/)
    - Still read this almost every day.
- Read [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses)
    - This has been a great resource for inspiration and drive with my work.
- Earn $100 with Lyft
- Earn $100 with Uber
- Earn $200 with Upwork 
    - I haven't made time for this, and it's not clear at this point if I will have time or the need to. Depends how the negotiations with work go.
- Eat Less, Eat Better, Drink More Water 
    - I feel like I have accomplished a lot here.
- Play [Chess](https://www.chesscademy.com/)
    - I haven't played since with Ben, but I moved my regularly scheduled time to wednesdays after work and before yoga, so I think this will be easier to get done moving forward.
- Learn a new [skill](https://medium.com/marketing-and-entrepreneurship/21-best-places-to-learn-new-skills-every-day-722fdaf7530c#.peg4gey2d)
    - I haven't learned any new skills this week :\[ Will block off some time this week for that.
- Try a new [hobby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_hobbies)
    - See previous
- Yoga 
    - I have made great progress here, returning to a weekly commitment to yoga. I want to make it more frequent but time is short these days.
- Kayaking 
    - I haven't been kayaking for months. Hopefully I will find time for this in the coming weeks, but I really need to get a hard kayak before that because mine has a leak =/
- Watch a [documentary](https://www.reddit.com/r/Documentaries/)
    - I cant remember the last time I watched a documentary :\[ will create a weekly event to remind myself.
- Blog post about each major area of focus. Enumerate learning and accomplishments, direction, and upcoming goals. 
    - Investment
    - Book Reviews
    - Machine Learning
    - Development
- Get [ubuntu](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1516778) running on Droid 4 
    - I started this, but it seems not to be quite on the same scale as the rest of these issues.

- Take a discovery flight 
    - This has gone to the back burner but assuming everything with work turns out how I want, this will likely happen soon.
- Sail 
    - It has gotten a little chilly, but I'd still like to try to stay in the habit when there is time. Hopefully in the next few weeks if things slow down.
- More Amateur Radio 
    - I have been engaging with content around this topic but have not actually done any radio since burning man. It has gone to the back burner with the chaos around work and school.
- More Scuba 
    - I would love to do scuba but this will need to wait until it is warmer.
- Practice Languages 
    - German
    - Japanese
    - French
