I have done a great deal of personal research and interviews with people in experimental and improvised communities about how they address individual-scale solutions to infrastructure problems. I've taken countless pages of notes and countless photos of the examples. As regional co-chair of Burners Without Borders, I am also working on deploying these solutions at homeless camps throughout the San Francisco bay area. This project is about working on compiling all of this into a simple set of categories which will hopefully make these solutions more accessible to people who are trying to learn how to solve these problems on an individual-scale.
