Yuval's previous book, [Sapiens](https://admin.blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2018/12/12/sapiens-by-yuval-harari/), covers the history of humanity. This book, [Homo Deus](https://amzn.to/2T4WG7d), covers the future of humanity. His next book after this covers today. [Homo Deus](https://amzn.to/2T4WG7d) was an interesting look at many of the forces which are shaping the world. Starting at the beginning is the right way to think about the future. Sapiens really dives into the cognitive, agricultural, and industrial revolutions. This book looks at the future from that historical perspective. What has changed, and what does it mean? What is therefore likely to happen moving forward? [![Homo Deus by Yuval Harari](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Homo-Deus-by-Yuval-Harari-1-1.jpg)](https://amzn.to/2T4WG7d)In particular, I found his perspective on what he calls "Dataism" fascinating. I think this is the right lens through which to view the modern world, and the right way to think about what is coming next. This concept promises to unite all the various disparate sciences under a single universal paradigm which also extends to nearly every part of humanity, as well as all our technology and the rest of the universe around us. It's a very exciting read!
