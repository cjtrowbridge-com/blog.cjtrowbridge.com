Lots of recent episodes of American Horror Story showcase the expression of maternal relationships, and a recent one finds a protagonist in conflict with his mother. Someone says to him that no matter how long he lives, if he finds the best people and relationships and lives happily ever after in a fairy tale, he will never find anyone who loves him half as much as his mother does. Our family has been through so much, and I know what a cliche it is, but I also know that it's true. Talking recently with Ricky about the strength that he draws from his relationship with his mom, I was really compelled to reflect on the fact that you are the biggest part of me, and I wouldn't be half of what I am without you.
