This book sets the stage for its successor, Babylon's Ashes. The two books could almost be one. ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Nemesis_Games-1-1.jpg)The story focuses a lot more on Amos and Earth, and we see the return of Clarissa. Be ready to start on Babylon's ashes when you finish this, because it picks up right at the end and finishes the story here.
