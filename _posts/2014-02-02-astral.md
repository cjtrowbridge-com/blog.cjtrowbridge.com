<span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">When I became aware that I was conscious, I looked around and saw that all around me was a turbulence, a rushing; and it was made of stars and men. The turbulence made a sound. It was like the roaring of a thousand oceans, louder than ears could ever hear. </span>  
<span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">  
</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I was floating and I was quite still in the middle of it all, just looking at it and taking it in.</span>  
<span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">  
</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">I suddenly felt like I was not on the ground, and I looked down to see myself sleeping in my bed. </span>  
<span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">  
</span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">A rather unsettling feeling came over me that I was seeing more than I was supposed to, but that I had been made to feel that way unnaturally. This was the way I had been supposed to feel all along. </span>
