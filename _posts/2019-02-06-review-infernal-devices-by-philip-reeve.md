[Infernal Devices](https://amzn.to/2Gn5YYO) is book three in the Hungry Cities Chronicles. The first book was set in Europe and the sky. The second book was set on the polar ice cap. This third book is set at sea. It's an exciting adventure which is still very sociological. We explore themes of power and oppression dynamics with lots of action and explosions. Check out my reviews of [Mortal Engines](/2019/01/13/mortal-engines-by-philip-reeve/) and [Predator's Gold](/2019/01/16/predators-gold-by-philip-reeve/)!
