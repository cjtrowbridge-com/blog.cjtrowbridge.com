([View the full album here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/t6nB4TwG5K1xKYYh7)) Key West looked like it would be a lot of fun normally. It was kind of terrifying at the moment because basically not a single person was wearing a mask anywhere in the town, and everything was very close together so there wasn’t really any way of avoiding the unmasked hordes. I got to see the southernmost point in the continental United States! ![Southernmost Point](https://i0.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Southernmost-Point-rotated.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1)Walking around town was cute but again very crowded and very unmasked. There were lots of wild chickens and iguanas running around town.

It was used as a fort and later a prison. Eventually it became a sort of wildlife refuge and now it’s a national park. So here is the really frustrating part. It’s a three hour drive out to Key West where you can catch the ferry to the park. But the ferry is only privately run now, and the cheapest one I could find wanted $190/person for a ride, and not a single person in there was masked. It was not just a deathtrap but also an incredibly expensive one. I decided I had gotten close enough for this trip, and I’d save the island for next time. As a consolation prize, I got to see the southernmost Starbucks! ![Southernmost Starbucks](https://i2.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Southernmost-Starbucks-scaled.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1)
