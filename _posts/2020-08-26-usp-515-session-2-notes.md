#### Notes

- The professor presented a deductive argument for her perspective of environmental justice which features anthroprocentrism as a descriptive and absolute fact about the entire movement of environmental justice rather than a "most" or "some" argument. 
    - Several students offered counterexamples to reject the"all" argument, since there are many examples which disagree such as native traditions. The professor rejected these critiques of her position.
- Environmental justice features redress as a core duty. 
    - Reparations for historical injustices
