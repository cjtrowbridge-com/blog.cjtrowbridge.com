This is the third of five books in the Foundation series. It introduces Asimov's mentalics motif in the main; we meet many characters who like the Mule, have the power of telepathic emotional control over others. We learn a lot more about Seldon and his plan. The plan and those who execute it are forced to consider and implement tactics regarding individuals for the first time, rather than simply large groups. And we see the resurgence of a defeated foundation facilitated in large part by an unwitting teenager. ![Second Foundation by Isaac Asimov](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Second-Foundation-Isaac-Asimov-1-1.jpg)In the first half of this book, the Mule at the head of the defeated First Foundation is desperately seeking the Second Foundation, the only force which he believes could eventually threaten him. In the second half of the book, we see the Second Foundation looking for direction as the plan hangs by a thread and it tries to grapple the various factors conspiring against the plan throughout the galaxy. This was a really great read. I don't know why I waited so long to get this far in the series! 10/10.
