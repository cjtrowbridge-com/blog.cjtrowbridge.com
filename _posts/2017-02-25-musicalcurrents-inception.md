This week, I bought a new domain [MusicalCurrents.com](https://musicalcurrents.com/) themed off my work with [Angela Lombardi](https://www.facebook.com/leturd) at [The Maltese](https://www.facebook.com/themaltese), and I discussed licensing and legal requirements with [Neal Osincup](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nealwestmedia/), a prolific radio producer and old friend of mine. Angela and I were trying to build an audience for current music which wasn't present on the radio in Chico at the time. ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/musicalcurrents-1-1.gif)I intend for this podcast to start out as a very simple weekly recap of the top 40; just verse/chorus plus a sentence or two about each track. This is something I've often wanted to find in order to stay up to date with my knowledge. I think it could easily branch out into other genres if it becomes popular, but the primary goals at this point are

- Building an audience for myself as a DJ after a long hiatus.
- Building sample content as a resume
- Educating myself on the most current content.

I bought a used [Pioneer](https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/product/controller/ddj-sb/black/overview/) [DDJ-SB](https://serato.com/hardware/pioneer-ddj-sb) controller at [Guitar Center](http://www.guitarcenter.com/), and I'm planning to get another set of [JBL EON 315](http://www.jblpro.com/www/products/vintage/vintage-portable/eon300-series/eon315) speakers in the next month or two. Once I get a couple wireless mics and some lights, I will have an MVP and be ready to start DJing live events again. The controller I bought is currently on a 30-day hold per local laws, but once I pick it up from Guitar Center, I think I will be ready to get started with producing my first podcast episode! Stay tuned.
