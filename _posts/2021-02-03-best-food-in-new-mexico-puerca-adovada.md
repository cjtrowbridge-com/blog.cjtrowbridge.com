We stopped in Albuquerque for several reasons. First because It’s an extremely long way from The Painted Desert to Taos. Second because we needed to shower and do laundry. Third because they have the best rated place for the famous Puerca Adovada which everyone online seems to agree is the best food in New Mexico. So we got a spot at the KOA in Bernalillo for two nights. We got our Puerca Adovada from Mary &amp; Tito’s. ![](https://i0.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Puerca-Adovada-Large.jpg?resize=780%2C780&ssl=1)Basically it’s cubes of pork that are marinated in special local chiles and then covered in salsa. Super delicious. Very interesting textures and flavors. The rojo was a little spicy for Joe but the verde was just right. I’m partial to the rojo myself. I was really interested in the architecture of old town. There were lots of really cool adobe courtyards and walkways like this one. ![](https://i0.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Adobe-Courtyard-Large-rotated.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1)I loved the clever integration of benches into the walls and as separators to delineate public spaces. ![](https://i2.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Adobe-Bench-Large-rotated.jpg?resize=780%2C1040&ssl=1)There was also a lot of really cool mosaic work in the walkways. I got a lot of Gaudi vibes. ![](https://i2.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mosaic-Large-rotated.jpg?resize=780%2C1040&ssl=1)
