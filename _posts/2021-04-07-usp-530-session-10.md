****April 7th** **Session Ten: Infrastructure: Water, Waste, Energy, Transportation, Building, Food****

This session will focus on how changes in urban infrastructure can help cities become more inclusive, resilient, productive, livable, and sustainable. We will be guided by the following questions:

- Infrastructure: Infrastructure refers to the long-lived engineered structures central to economic and social development. (Slightly modified version of the [world bank definition](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/category/blog/sociology/urban-studies/usp514-sustainable-development/).) 
    - A set of fundamental facilities and systems that support the sustainable functionality of households and businesses
    - The services and facilities necessary for its economy to function
    - Composed of public and private physical structures such as roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, and telecommunications (including internet connectivity and broadband access.) In general
    - The physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions and maintain the surrounding environment
    - In the face of the massive societal living conditions and maintain the surrounding environment
    - Acknowledging this importance, the international community has created policy focused on sustainable infrastructure through the SDGs especially SDG 9 "Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure."

**Class Topics**1. What changes need to occur in the water sector?

    - Decentralization of production and storage
4. What changes need to occur in the transportation sector? 
    - Mass transit must be accessible to everyone 
        - And only then, heavy incentives for not using personal cars
    - Electrification 
        - Plus better sources of electricity
5. What changes need to occur in the building sector? 
    - Drastically cheaper construction
    - In lieu fees much higher than cost of building affordable units
    - More sustainable materials
6. What changes need to occur in the food sector? 
    - Crop subsidies must end
    - Nitrogen loading must be banned
    - Pesticide use must end

    - Our infrastructure has historically been badly maintained
    - The energy consumed by our infrastructure is often not sustainably sourced
- Discussion of structural adjustment and neoliberal privatization of infrastructure, and the impacts on infrastructure decay
