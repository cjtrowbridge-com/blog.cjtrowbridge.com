****March 3rd** **Session Six: Surveillance in Cities - Assignment #1 DUE TODAY****

This session will focus on the impact of increased surveillance in cities. For every 1,000 people in SF, there are over 3 cameras and the District Attorney’s office has access to almost ⅔ or their data ([ABC7 News](https://abc7news.com/surveillance-cameras-san-francisco-which-city-has-the-most-cameras-who-is-watching-me/5541752/)). Cameras are disproportionately in Tenderloin, Chinatown, DogPatch, Mission, Union Square. San Francisco ranks fourth in the United States in a study on public surveillance cameras. We will be guided by the following questions:

1. What do we mean by the term “surveillance”?
2. How does increased surveillance in cities effect urban populations?
3. What forms does surveillance take in cities?
4. How does surveillance impact different groups differently?
5. What strategies and policies can people/groups use to protect themselves from unwanted surveillance

## Notes

We talked about the challenges of urban planning when you're ordering communities subvert your plans and specifically the example of Berkeley and Emeryville This was connected to the implications of trying to do planning around banning cars and gas stations and car lots because they'll just go outside your jurisdiction We talked about IOT and the fact that it doesn't necessarily give people more power but instead it gives corporations more power She said we need to think about; - who is making the app and why
- where is the data going
- who is using the app.

These three lenses are the lenses through each of you IOT related issues We talked about the problem of tracking online and the fact that even with all of these pseudo options like disabling location sharing and disabling cookies it actually makes no difference whatsoever as to whether these companies can track you and sell information about you
