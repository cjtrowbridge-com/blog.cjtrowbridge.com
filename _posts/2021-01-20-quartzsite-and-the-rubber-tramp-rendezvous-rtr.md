<main class="site-main" id="main"><article class="post-13674 post type-post status-publish format-standard has-post-thumbnail hentry category-2021-winter" id="post-13674"><div class="entry-content">Here’s me, the moving cabin, and my first ever Saguaro on the morning when I arrived at Quartzsite! I met up with a group of nomads and we camped together for several weeks. The meetup was very very strict with covid compliance which was great. We had a great time getting to know each other safely. I think some of these new friendships will last for years. ![My First Saguaro](https://i2.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/My-First-Saguaro-scaled.jpg?resize=780%2C637&ssl=1)I really liked camping at Plomosa Rd. It was a big open space with lots of room for social distancing. ![Quartzsite Camp](https://i0.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Quartzsite-Camp.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1)Here you can see my evolving camp setup. I moved the cooler onto the table which makes a perfectly sized standing desk for working. The [outhouse tent](https://amzn.to/3tzIxBo) worked out great. I really like the fancy [flushing toilet](https://amzn.to/3cQxuhd) I bought. I am using these [bio-pods](https://amzn.to/3tL0Tjc) which are like a tide pod that you drop in and it eliminates any smell. Camping on BLM land, you just have to dig a hole and dump the toilet into the hole when it fills up. Very clean and simple solution for individual-scale human waste management. ![Quartzsite Andromeda](https://i1.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Quartzsite-Andromeda.jpg?resize=320%2C320&ssl=1)It’s a little hard to see but here in the middle of this photo is the [Andromeda Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy) which is coming straight at us. This is definitely the best photo I’ve ever managed to take of it, and I took it here at Quartzsite! ![Moving Theater](https://i1.wp.com/movingcabin.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Moving-Theater.jpg?resize=780%2C585&ssl=1)On several of the nights, I set up my projector to show movies on the side of a neighbor’s camper. This was a fun and safe activity as we were able to space out over a large area to enjoy the movie together. Quartzsite was amazing. I will absolutely go back every year. I ended up giving the bike away to someone I met there, so it will not be appearing in future posts! </div><footer class="entry-footer"></footer></article></main>
