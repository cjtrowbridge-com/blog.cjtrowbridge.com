I have moved to Oakland, CA to focus on getting a degree in Urban Studies at SFSU as well as working on lots of exciting queer activism and housing activism. Here is my updated everyday carry. ![edc](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/MVIMG_20200302_221500-1-1.jpg)

- [Combination Charger and Battery](https://amzn.to/2vp0w4A) This is life changing. Why are all chargers not also batteries!?
- [Short Right-Angle USB-C Cords](https://amzn.to/3csfuHC) Having a
- [Asus C302CA Laptop with USB-C Charging](https://amzn.to/32HPWli) If I was buying a new laptop today, I would still get this one. It's light,quick, durable and excellent. Having USB-C charging makes things so much simpler.
- [Wallet Case](https://amzn.to/2TssTXq) for Pixel
- Custom Burning Man Phone Sticker (Sry)
- [Trayvax Original Wallet](https://amzn.to/2VE74a0)
- [Cheap Waterproof Bluetooth Headphones](https://amzn.to/3cvWMyX) have lasted three years so far!
- [Mace and Tazer](https://amzn.to/2vC2oXF) for those late night walks from Bart
- [Leatherman Wingman](https://amzn.to/3cpxqTd) I have tried a lot of alternatives and this one is great.
- [KeySmart Pro with Tile and Flashlight](https://amzn.to/2vqmh3Y)
- [Lego Boba Fett Keychain](https://amzn.to/32QuElt) Boba Fett is not a Mandalorian but he dresses like one. There is also [a version](https://amzn.to/2TwkDpo) which has a cape.
- [Lego Yoda Keychain](https://amzn.to/3csiinW) combine Boba with Yoda and to most, it seems like you have keychains of Baby Yoda and Din Djarin.
