My annual unique viewers for the last year now totals more than 28 million. Getting here has been quite a journey. Choosing what to do next has been the journey of the last several years, and I'm excited to report that while I'm still not quite sure, I have a much better idea than I did a year ago. ![My annual unique viewers for the last year totals more than 28 million](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/457153516_10169629028320722_9073348714467606594_n.jpg)

### Making Enough Money To Do The Things I Want To Do

 I have been working for about the past seven years to put pieces into motion towards an eventual goal which is looking nearer and nearer every day. I'm feeling very excited about announcing this and taking the first big steps on this path, hopefully sooner than later. #### Manufacturing

 For our seventh land project together, we find ourselves fundraising during the opening days of global stagflation in a landscape where cost of living is skyrocketing while jobs are disappearing. This has been a struggle, and it's going to be a longer path than it first looked like, but it's still coming. #### Castro Media

 Starting a media group to focus on QTBIPOC perspectives on progress will add a much needed and somehow conspicuously absent voice of community organization around current events centering on the material conditions of impacted populations in the Castro and beyond. #### [Risk-Based Sustainable Investment Strategy](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/2024/08/28/risk-based-strategy-for-sustainable-investment/)

 I want to create a community endowment focused on investing in community resiliency and sustainability. This includes a strategic approach to constructing an ESG investment portfolio focusing on the second-order effects of long-term environmental, social, and governance risks. By understanding and analyzing these effects—such as operational disruptions, economic downturns, and regulatory backlash—we can identify companies that are well-positioned to survive and thrive through the many coming disasters, so that our communities can survive and thrive with them.
