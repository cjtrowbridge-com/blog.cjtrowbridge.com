This has been one of my favorite books since I was a child. When I heard the announcement that this year's theme for Burning Man is going to be "I, Robot," I decided to reread it. It's still one of the best books I've ever read. I can not say this enough, THIS BOOK HAS ALMOST NOTHING TO DO WITH THE TERRIBLE WILL SMITH MOVIE BY THE SAME NAME. ![](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/i_robot-1-1.jpg)This book was written nearly a century ago, and yet it deals with many of the issues we are starting to face today;

- The rise of Artificial Intelligence and the reaction to it.
- The realization that humans are not running the show anymore, and the assertion that this is a good thing.
- The definition of what it means to be a person.
- The alignment problem; "How do we know they want the same things we want."

At just 253 pages, it goes by quick. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence. It is also a great first step into the vast universe of the very prolific Asimov. I can't wait until his dozens of books start being made into good movies. The Foundation series especially is going to be amazing.
