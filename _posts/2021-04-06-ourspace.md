A distributed alternative social media system based on RSS over IPFS and using BitTorrent to distribute media attachments. Use something like ENS to resolve usernames to a wallet public address and corresponding RSS feed file of their posts. People could easily restrict their feed to only be viewable to friends, like how TOX works, and then they can subscribe to RSS feeds they're interested in from friends, podcasts, etc.
