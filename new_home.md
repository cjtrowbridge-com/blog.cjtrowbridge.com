<div>## [Random Incomplete Ideas](/category/blog/projects/ideas/)

*I have long struggled with what to do with random ideas I have. I kept a journal and then I kept a todo list and then I made a database and it was just too much, especially because I wanted to be able to go back and do drafts of the ideas. So here we are, my unfiltered stream of consciousness, probably altered. Enjoy.***Note:** *There are really a lot of these so I'm trying to add a few every day. It will be a while until they are all added.*![Ideeeeaaaa](https://blog.cjtrowbridge.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Ideeeeaaaa-1-1.jpg)[rpfc_recent_posts_from_category category="782" posts="30"] </div>---
